We arrived 45 mins late and Matt was very helpful and accommodating.  He kindly  told us that we could call or text him at any time. Wifi is available which was great.

The following review is based on our personal preferences and is not a reflection of Matt or the information given by him but we hope it will be helpful to other people at our """"stage of the game""""  We did not have good weather in Austin and the apartment has no comfortable place to sit and read a book - the only seating is 2 hard kitchen chairs.  There are no windows in the apartment - the doors have glass in them but for privacy the blinds need to be closed.  If you are tall the shower will be a problem for you.  There were no drinking glasses wine glasses coffee filters - only 2 mugs and a few plates no chest of drawers.  The cupboard door was broken off its hinges and could not be closed.  Having said that we loved Austin and this location was perfect - walking distance to downtown great restaurants S Congress theaters Lady Bird Lake.

Being new to the Air BnB community I must admit I was nervous about how this might work.  Joe was professional with a nice welcome packet that clearly lined out how the BnB would work and the very basic common sense guidelines he wished for us to keep in mind.  He was also personable and even was willing to help us with the possibility of a second vehicle even though there was just one parking space for the BnB.  We didn't need to utilize this but he was so conscientious and helpful all the way through.  The home was immaculate and was carefully appointed for every basic need a guest could have.  I will definitely stay at one of Joe's properties unless he is booked.    As to being new to Air BnB well Joe has set the bar high.

Totally lovely and charming place  perfect for our weekend getaway. It was very clean and private. It is very convenient to the freeway and so quiet. My wife loved the impressionist artwork. We stayed there with our 2 dogs and it was great to be able to let them explore the yard. We only bumped into Sara once the whole time.  There was plenty of parking on the street and it was a safe neighbourhood. The  cafe Cherrywood around the corner had really good food tacos especially. The best part is that everything is close by downtown is less than a 7 minute drive so we were able to explore Zilker Park walk part of the trail and check out the famous 6th street..(a bit too youngish for us..). Don't forget to bring a laptop as there is no TV (couldn't miss my soccer team playing) but there are plenty of books.

Daniel is a great host and the apartment is wonderful. Lots of room with a king sized bed very comfortable linens walk in closet and a beautifully remodeled kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet but within walking distance to a convenient bus stop that will take you downtown in just minutes. There is private backyard with 2 entrances to the guest house. I provided a grocery list to Daniel a few days before my stay and when I arrived the fridge was stocked with the items I needed. He even let me borrow his bike for a trip to nearby Zilker Park which is beautiful. The experience was fantastic from start to finish. I have no regrets and will definitely stay here again if I ever get back to Austin. Thanks Daniel.,1/12/2013,213651,Daniel,3330807,104099,Zilker Guesthouse,1,Ken,54000072

The Cottage is truly ADORABLE - it gets great light is the perfect size and is well laid out. Andy and Ellen go above and beyond by providing fresh organic foods paraben-free toiletries good linens great restaurant recommendations guides and directions an awesome radio (Austin has terrific stations!) really good books and 2 bikes with helmets all in good condition. They even allow you to use their washer and dryer! They were very gracious easy and laid back hosts. There were a couple of pretty MINOR drawbacks: the heater is a tad on the loud side the bikes needed a little cleaning before use (just a quick rinse really) and the neighbors were doing what seemed like a small renovation project a couple of days which wouldn't normally be a big deal but we were trying to escape our landlord's endless renovations and wanted to lay around and read in the mornings. Please don't let these little things discourage you from staying here (we just like to be totally up front and thorough). We had a wonderful time and instantly felt right at home. We never even had to knock on their door because they thought of everything we could have wanted!,1/13/2013,378744,Andy & Ellen,3338331,72833,Central Cottage with bikes!,1,Erika & Carey,54000078

Bill's place is wonderful!  You can tell that he and his wife enjoy hosting because they've paid attention to every detail.  They knew I was in town for my birthday and had a balloon on the door when I arrived.  Upon entering the apt. you're greeted by the smell of a freshly cleaned home and quirky sculpture showing you the way upstairs. At the top the place is simply and tastefully decorated.  Everything is top of the line.  They've maximized the space with a seating area where you can enjoy the magazines and many books about Austin and the area that they've left to share.  There's a kitchen space with coffee and all the fixings and they even stock the fridge with some surprise goodies.  The bed and linens are very comfortable and at night you get a view of the congress building downtown.  The bathroom while small had everything: nice bathrobes body wash shampoo & conditioner and very nice towels.  In fact even my husband commented that if might be time for nicer towels at home!  It's pretty cute they even leave a toothbrush and razor in case you've forgotten yours.  The proximity to South Congress is perfect.  Close enough to walk to everything but far enough to get a quiet night of sleep.  Privacy was no issue.  I think I saw the homeowners come and go a couple of times but I never met them.  However with the handwritten note and fresh flowers they leave I felt very welcomed.  It would be a pleasure to visit Bill's place again.,1/14/2013,3626574,Bill,3345889,705858,Luxury Carriage House-Travis Height,1,Nicole,54000085
We had such a wonderful weekend at the Austinville Cottage!  The cottage is comfortable and in the best location ever.  You can walk to so many different restaurants -- we had a marvelous dinner at Lenoir one evening and what have to be Austin's best chicken at Mrs. P's Electric Cock the next day for lunch!  SoCo also is great for wandering and checking out the fun random stores - of course I ended up with a vintage leather jacket with fringe I mean how could I not?  The outdoor area at the cottage is perfect too for hanging out with friends listening to the CREEK and there is even a heat lamp.

My girlfriend and I flew to Austin on a whim and a hunch looking to see what it was all about. We spent a week based out of the Bird House in the ultra-hip SoCo neighborhood. As it turns out the best part of our get-away was staying here! The accommodations went above and beyond  - coffee tea (email hidden)! Not to mention fresh towels linens books and a full kitchen. We saved a lot of money eating breakfast in the house before romping around each day. The location was great - beautiful safe and convenient.  However if you're planning on getting around Austin quite a bit the bus can be a bit of a walk (7 min max). I would suggest a rental car. All in all it was an honor to stay at the Bird House and be the guests of such gracious hosts.

We had a lovely time staying in this well-appointed and extremely well-located apartment. The place itself was perfect for our group of four (one person each in two of the three bedrooms and two of us shared the 3rd bedroom with twin beds) and much more comfortable than staying in a hotel. The open living room/dining room was great for hanging out after a long day of business meetings and the flat screen TV was a good distraction for some much needed down time. After we'd recovered from our days night life and great restaurants were all just a stone's throw away. We were easily able to walk to restaurants and live music.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Jacob’s apartment.  Everyone – our Austin friends cab drivers – all commented on how awesome the location was.  The place really is directly across from the Capitol and walking distance to pretty much everything downtown.  East 6th and South Congress are really short cab rides away.  The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures.  I can be a bit high maintenance about where I stay and I was extremely satisfied with the apartment - it is clean super comfortable (especially the bed) and has everything you need.  Jacob was very easy to work with – we had a bit of a problem with the lock and he was extremely accommodating.  Compared to the cost of hotels in downtown Austin this place was a fantastic deal.  This was our first AirBnB experience but it won’t be our last.  I would recommend Jacob’s place to anyone!,1/21/2013,3389824,Raquel + Jacob,3384162,669469,Historical Loft with Capitol View!,1,Rochelle,54000132

This house was a fantastic find.  It looks somewhat modest from the front but it is surprisingly large when you enter and Lyon has clearly put a lot of time and energy into the place.  There are two outdoor deck areas and a large sun room all of which were great for me and six of my friends to hang out and catch up during a mini college reunion.  The master bedroom has its own outdoor access s well as a really nice steam room.  The location was great very close to lots of good E.

Love the house. Very clean and kitch. the neighborhood was splendid and very walkable. The house was like a hidden gem on the street. It was great that the hosts left beer and salsa for the evening and apple juice milk and granola for cereal in the morning. The space was perfect not too big and not too small. The owners were very thoughtful with access to a bicycle and a key for the lock. Or for instance bug spray on the porch. It was very affordable and lovely. I hope to stay here again when I am in town. The owners left all sorts of tips and even the wifi password.

We had 2 young kids  (1 &4 yrs) staying at Erik's place. The total is 4 people!. The older girl stay upstairs... she loves the spiral staircase. The youngest stayed with us in a crib downstairs. Erik was very accommodating by removing as much baby dangerous items as possible. Although it was not completely baby safe it was a fair accommodation. To prevent the youngest from climbing the spiral staircase we made a gate using a cardboard sheet strings and a clip to attached to the stairs rail. It worked. The location was awesome! I selected the location because it was walking distant to my husband's work. And also it was significantly cheaper than staying at a corporate housing that the company was offering. [We had a relocation allowance if we go over we pay out of pocket]. I would recommend this place to visitors families and relocated people.,1/28/2013,1654178,Erik & Crystal,3424992,323733,4th St Loft in Downtown Austin!,1,Austina,54000202

Sara's Soco/Travis Heights house is lovely indeed! We (a couple) stayed for a month and a half beginning the first of Jan. The house is located on the edge of the park running through Travis Heights (perfect for a walk or jog) and also right across from the neighbourhood spring-fed swimming pool. It is situated conveniently for both Congress Avenue and Oltorf. The house is cutely and conveniently appointed including all the necessities and it put a smile on our faces from the moment we walked though the door; It looks just like the photos. We were super-comfy and had lots of space to unpack our belongings. The kitchen is huge and has everything you could need. The house also has a large back yard-- It is surprising to look up in the middle of the city and see so many stars!! We slept really great and had nice naps on both beds. Communication with Sara was friendly and timely and she is a helpful and savvy host and a kind/cool person. As we had quite a long stay Sara helped arrange for her cleaners to come while we were there which was awesome and one less thing to fuss with. During our stay we had a lot to get done in Austin so we needed the roof over our head to be a no-brainer--just to work smoothly and feel homey and relaxing and it totally did!

Fiona was a great host and the little cottage is straight-up adorable. I'm still newish to this Airbnb business so I showed up on the wrong doorstep (Fiona's home rather than the adjacent cottage) and she was more than gracious about it walking me over to show me how to use some appliances and such. She also gave me great input on places to eat in the area. The location is fantastic too. I headed out for a walk to one of the recommended restaurants and ended up spending the day tooling around downtown on foot. I really didn't appreciate how close this east-side spot was to everything. The state Capitol is about two miles away. The only hitch with the location is that my online maps had a little trouble finding it and so did the cab driver who came to pick me up for the airport. I think GPS really wants to put you on the next street over so it's something to keep in mind. Also I stayed here solo -- totally perfect and half the price of the Sheraton would've been -- but if I'd been with someone other than my husband the bathroom might have been too close to the bed to feel comfy. That said the bathroom is one of the coolest-looking parts of the place. All in all it's a perfect little spot to have your own kitchen in an interesting part of town rather than a stale hotel room.

We will certainly plan to stay here again the next time we visit our daughter and her family for any length of time and with one small caveat can confidently recommend it to others. The small caveat is that the bed is in the kitchen (or the kitchen is in the bedroom) so that if one of a couple gets up much earlier than the other and wishes to make coffee or breakfast he/she needs to be very quiet about it!,2/4/2013,1855238,Caroline,3471515,367445,Charming Hyde Park Casita,1,Patrick,54000248

We travel to Austin  to visit our son and find the location of the cottage very convenient to the South Congress area and his neighborhood.

We enjoy having the independence of our own separate space and really enjoy staying there.

Elizabeth the hostess made sure the unit was ready with towels clean sheets cable and internet. Parking is on the street though it's not generally a problem. The owner and the bungalow do share a wall so you may hear them moving around a bit  and of course the mirror is also probably true.

This was an amazing find.  The quintessential Austin bungalow in an ideal location.  We loved drinking wine on the front porch at night with the beautiful view of the twinkly downtown skyline; grilling out back by the airstream with the French lighting overhead; the dark mahogany wood floors; the high quality sheets and big bed; the leather couch; all of the amenities like flatscreen TV surround sound etc.  Best of all East 6th was just a short walk and South Congress and downtown were a short bike ride away (we loved the bikes too!). Morning jogs by the lake added a nice touch. Morning coffee at Cenote cafe and lunch at Mr. Natural (I think we saw Matthew McConaughey there!).  The Western Art (by A.

A few weeks ago I took a look on Airbnb to find a clean room to stay for an upcoming workshop in Austin TX. I got a whole lot more than I ever expected. The place I found was just plain amazing. It was as clean and neat as any 5 star hotel but cooler than any boutique hotel anywhere. Full kitchen with everything I needed great balconies to take in the surroundings and the walls adorned with fascinating works of art. My bedroom was well appointed the linens and towels were luxurious and the place was like something out of a hip design magazine. I had this feeling that everything had some kind of story attached to it and after meeting my host I was right. This is one traveled person who has loves to entertain and be a host. And the house reflects that. Susan pays a lot of attention to the little details that make this such a great place to stay. And the location is about as good as it gets in Austin. I could walk to South Congress restaurants cafes and shops in no time. There is all the city bustle nearby yet this little pocket of Travis Heights is quiet and great for walking or biking. This small condo complex itself is inviting. I’ve also learned that it is possible to rent the entire unit as well.

I've used Airbnb a lot and Gretchen's place is one of the most amazing places I've found. After spending two full weeks there working with my dad on a photo shoot I cannot recommend her home enough. It's in a quiet area but very close to the best part of Austin. Gretchen herself is warm and welcoming beyond words she graciously let us have a (pretty loud) party on the porch one night and stopped by a couple times to see if we needed anything. Her dogs are great as well i loved having them around. And the house itself is the epitome of quirky Austin spirit cozy and comfortable and so full of personality. We ended up using it as a location for several shoots because the decor was just that cool. Next time i'm in austin I will definitely be back.

I definitely recommend staying here!  I was looking for something last minute and they were able to accommodate the request.  The house was extremely clean and very comfortable.  The decor was very nice and I loved the stone fireplace!  There were 3 bedrooms off the front left side of the house which shared a nice size bathroom and a very large master suite off the back with was great!  Our kids were able to play safely in the fenced-in backyard (they have a swingset) and the adults could easily keep as eye from the living room and kitchen (which was a great space to socialize!).  In the morning the sun would shine in the large living room window which was very peaceful to just sit and drink coffee while the kids watched cartoons.  The location was also perfect as it was only a few blocks from the highway which gave us quick access to downtown the groceryrestaurants stores and  the theater.

This was my first airbnb experience and I felt like I was gambling alot bringing my wife brother sister-in-law and a dog.  We'd stayed in hotels on our past visits and I hated being car-centric in such a cool town.  So I took a chance and boy did it ever pay off.  I probably didn't make things easy on Angel but her detailed instructions and the fact that she met us to go over everything at check-in made everything eased my anxiety.  Everything about the home seems a little better than the listing.  The location was absolutely prime for us walking to the start of the Austin Marathon and back home from the finish.  The bicycles came in really handy for the non-runners too.  We found several restaurants and coffee shops that made us feel like locals instead of tourists which is really the way we wanted to experience Austin.

Kim may have forever spoiled all future air bnb experiences for me because she set the bar so high and this was my first time!  It started with a super quick response to a last-minute booking.  Then Kim greeted me upon arrival with a hug and a smile.  We were fast friends and Kim was a gracious host who truly loves the hosting part of the experience: first stop delicious tacos at the Torchies food truck just across the street. Next up a tour to the East Side of town where we danced our behinds off to some fantastic music at the Gypsy Cafe.  When I wanted to do my own thing she would point me in the right direction or give me rides if she could (including to the airport!).  Her house was lovely bright clean spacious and in a great location.  I was able to easily walk downtown and to the South First businesses and food trucks with no issue.  Great experience all-around.

The bathroom and other amenities are exactly as described. It was perfect for one person and I can see how 1-2 others could stay there comfortably as long as they are comfortable with one another.

Had a too short but great time in Austin.  Couldn't have asked for a more perfect location for what I wanted to do...Walk run and just be outside for as long as I could stay on my feet. I got in way later than planned met Lois who is very warm and welcoming.  Took off toward Zilker Park...very close walked to South Congress to explore the eclectic shops. Don't miss Ten Thousand Villages.  Walked back towards downtown area and headed to 6th street (not the bar area but the shopping area...actually didn't know it existed). Had a great experience at the Dogtooth headed to Whole Foods and then walked on home.... left at 5:40 home at 10:20...Felt safe.  Got home and chilled out in the very comfortable and eclectic loft (and I mean eclectic in the best way!) had a great night sleep and headed back out the next morning for a run.  As a single female this is a great starting point for exploring Austin. Great neighborhood (next time I am planning to bike through the neighborhood as it has very cool houses).

The Zilker House was perfect for my husband 15-month old and me.  It's very modern clean and comfortable and we loved the style/decor. Even better than the pictures!  It felt like home for our 7-night stay. Very child-friendly and the hosts provided crib high chair toys and even some organic milk! Mary was a wonderful host responding to any requests or questions we had immediately as well as providing great suggestions for kid playtime restaurants etc. We had lived in Austin previously but were not familiar with the neighborhood. Location was great -- within walking distance to many restaurants CVS playground/park and close to downtown Austin Town Lake trail Zilker Park etc. A block from South Lamar but nice and quiet.

My husband baby two cats and I stayed in Sheila's duplex for a week while our own house was being painted. Sheila was a gracious friendly and accommodating hostess. For example when I had trouble sleeping due to light coming in the windows at night she found and hung some temporary curtains which really helped (the shear curtains pictured in the bedrooms were not present; instead the windows had wooden blinds). However the home is in need of renovation. For example the linoleum in the main living area an hall is torn and worn in several spots and the kitchen and bathroom could definitely use an update. There is no dishwasher or microwave. One of the beds was very squeeky and kept us awake at night; we switched to the other bed. We enjoyed the large sliding glass doors during the day but at night the main living area was pretty dark. The baby enjoyed the nearby park and the cats were very comfortable.

We had an amazing stay at Sara's East Austin home.  The house is beautifully renovated and was a perfect space for the 3 of us who stayed.  We booked the home for the weekend of SXSW interactive and it ended up being a more ideal space than most hotels.  Our hosts provided snacks fresh eggs coffee beer and access to their garden.  Working on my laptop in the screened-in porch while enjoying coffee in the morning was quite relaxing.  The location was ideal just a short 10 minute walk from downtown and quiet at night.  It was also easy to get to via taxi or pedicab from downtown when we didn't feel like walking late at night.  The bedrooms were nicely separated gave lot of privacy and the common areas were spacious and comfortable to be in.  The hosts provided a blow-up mattress and bed in a separate room with pocket doors which allowed everyone to have their own private space.  The check-in/check-out process was a breeze.

Friday February 1 I paid Airbnb $956 for a three night  accommodation March 11 12 & 13. Sunday March 10 at 3:30PM Matt Schram called to inform me that the room I rented from him was not available the first night. He said he was trying to accommodate everyone for SXSW  and needed to move me to a smaller room. He said he would give me a cash refund. The room I got was a converted pantry and closet with a full size bed. Matt said that the best time to move to the large suite I paid for would be 2PM Tuesday March 12. I arranged my schedule to work with that. I was out early for a meeting and came back to take a nap and shower at 12:50PM. There were no pillowcases or sheets on the bed no towels in the bathroom. Therefore no nap or shower for me. At 2PM when I went to move to the room I originally rented. It was not yet cleaned. The cleaning lady was in the room and her daughter was napping on the couch. At 2:40PM she came out and told me the room was ready for me. The room turned out to be Matt's own bedroom/office which he still felt free to use although he rented it to me. I have rented many rooms and stayed in many B&B's in my travels for years. I have never run across a situation where the owner has someone rent his own personal room while he stays in the building. The room was filled with Matt's things. The closets and dressers were all full. There was no where to hang clothes. It was strange and uncomfortable to say the least. There were no shades on the window at the head of the bed no towels in the bathroom.  When I was in the room Tuesday March 12 at 4PM taking a nap Matt unlocked the door and entered the room. He did not knock. He said he needed to get some shampoo and get cleaned up. Was he going to use my shower?  I guess he still felt it was his shower and room to use freely although I paid Airbnb $956 for it. He came into the room and got something from the bathroom. I felt so uncomfortable and cheated at this point that I gathered my stuff left the house and found other accommodations. Matt showed no regard for privacy schedule space. There was continuous construction in the house broken refrigerator dog hair covered couches. I have had no response from Matt and I have received no refund of any kind. For $956 I spent one night in a room that was much smaller than the one for which I paid. I incurred more expenses on my trip and missed appointments as a result.,3/15/2013,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt,3788464,758470,Master Suite King bed lrg Bath SoCo,1,Ray,54000986

Fantastic location for SXSW (or any other time of year) - right in the middle of the action.

I stayed at the fantastic casa de Tsang with two colleagues during our stop over for SXSW. I have to say the vibe of the Tsang home is fantastic warm welcoming and tastefully curated. The accommodations were similar to that of a hotel stay with fresh towels soaps and even fresh fruit and pastries upon arrival! The house was absolutely comfortable and Karen and fam did a great job of making us feel right at home during our stay. Although they were on site in an adjoined back house during our stay they were totally friendly and did a great job of keeping it casual and non intrusive. the neighborhood is close to the airport as well as downtown so it makes for a perfect location. We even found a really cool park on airport with a cement  mini ramp to skate on our way out of town!  look forward to staying with them again on my next trek through Austin.

What can I say!? One of the most outstanding airbnb experiences I've ever had!  The house was clean light more than enough space for the 6 of us!  The airstreamer caravan out back was fully kitted out and a novel and comfortable experience!  There is a gorgeous house cat who we named Adele (real name Marty) who plied us with affection.  Andi was a fantastic host warm friendly helpful and on the few occasions we had questions she was on our doorstep in less than 5 minutes!

We had a fantastic stay in Texas! Blanca and Christian were great hosts and very accommodating. Christian was only there the last day of our stay but was easy to communicate with during the booking process and very flexible. They arranged rides for us to and from the airport. In the mornings we were welcome to coffee toast and fruit. Blanca was available to answer any questions we had and even offered to let me use her bike since we didn't have a vehicle to and from the downtown area. We were able to catch a bus two blocks from their house and take a quick 30 minute ride downtown. We rented bikes during our stay which was about a 45-50 minute bike ride.

Their house is absolutely lovely and the images/description are completely accurate.  Only exception is that the house is now painted a fun fire engine RED!  The house is very convenient to South Congress and a few great restaurants right on 1st street.  Walking downtown took about 30 minutes.  The number 5 bus is literally right in the front lawn if you need to get somewhere quicker. We didn't have a car and found the location of the house completely manageable.

It stays between the two big bedrooms. Everything is new! Kitchen is large with every appliance you can think of. (And actually a few I've never seen before).

The best sun light a large table comfortable chairs in every corner a hammock in the shadow and...AN AIRSTREAM!!!! The AIRSTREAM is an experience at its own. It's so cool.

Matt was a good host - flexible and friendly - and his house is beautiful. Best of all it's in a fantastic location just behind Magnolia on South Congress. We stayed both in the main house (in the gorgeous high-ceilinged master suite complete with balcony - thanks Matt!) and then in the separate studio out in the backyard. The master suite is lovely and Matt managed to accommodate us there after a double booking which meant there wasn't room for us in the room downstairs I'd originally booked. Later in the week when my friends left I moved to Matt's separate studio for a few days. I preferred the studio for its privacy and self-sufficiency and spent happy hours on the sunny roof terrace above. The wifi is speedy the beds are comfy and when the sun's out the yard is a great place to hang out. The dog and cats are very sweet too. The studio's contents are basic (bring your own washing up liquid kitchen cloth cutlery...) but perhaps its intended for people who mostly eat out. If the weather is bad I think you'd get stir-crazy pretty quickly as it's not a huge space (it has a bed and kitchen table/chairs but not a sofa) and there isn't a huge amount of natural light. But it was ideal for me on my own both working on my laptop and hanging out on vacation and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

"""The hideaway was a great way to start off our trip to Austin. Just a very quick drive or 10 minute walk to SoCo Or a 40 min walk to downtown.

Awesome place to stay. . . Pics totally accurate. Was here for a full week for an academic research trip with 2 colleagues.

Also notable David stopped by and saved us mid-week by re-stocking coffee filters (and coffee beans while he was at it). . . Great trails nearby for exercise.

We had a few late nights where we couldn't get a bus but the taxi was only $10-15 from either South Congress or Sixth Street.

We just returned from Austin last night and Lindsay's Austin Downtown Retreat was indeed a treat. We were a party of six adult males in town to watch the NCAA basketball games. The house is old but everything was in good condition and clean. We appreciated the big screen TVs for the late games on our off nights. The location was good with a good blend of restaurants and bars within walking distance 2 breakfast places right around the corner and grocery stores nearby. With the bus stop at the corner (we did not need to rent a car) we were able to get to the campus and other sites very easily. The neighborhood was quiet and well maintained. I would not hesitate to rent again.,3/26/2013,1710302,Lindsay,3904134,336042,Downtown Austin Retreat,1,Dennis,54001321

My friend and I stayed at the Austinville cottage for four nights and it was fantastic!  Chris is an amazing host.  Both of our flights were delayed and then rescheduled several times and Chris was so accommodating about rearranging our pick up times at the airport. (He picked us each up at separate times and then dropped us off at the airport too!).  Chris toured us both around the city and provided a great gift certificate to an amazing Vietnamese restaurant also.  The cottage itself was clean and really comfortable with nice extras like lots of cold drinks and  toiletries if we forgot anything.  We both felt completely relaxed and at home.  I also loved his three dogs and the goats were fun too!  The location was perfect too.  We walked everywhere.

This was my first airbnb experience. I confess that I was nervous about staying in staying in someone's home but Peggy was a very warm and gracious hostess and put me right at ease. My room was comfortable and as pictured. The air mattress was very comfy - quite sturdy and firm. I was there for a week and relied on frozen meals but there was plenty of freezer space and access to the kitchen was no problem. Peggy made it easy to navigate her kitchen as she's labeled the cabinets and drawers which I thought was clever. The bathroom was shared but I was always able to use it whenever I wanted without waiting and there were plenty of towels on hand. I was able to use the washer/dryer which I thought was a very nice perk. All in all a very comfortable stay!

We adored the cozy bed that made relaxation instantaneous as well as the cool couch where naps could materialize. Everything was spotless modern and really cool down to the coffee maker and fridge. The snacks and drinks such as granola beer and fruit juice greeted us after a long journey and quenched our taste buds immediately. Really this was an ideal place to stay.

"""It's impossible for me to be objective about this experience as I fell in love with the hosts and their dogs. Seasha and I really hit it off and it felt way more like a slumber party than renting a room. They are both interesting smart and helpful. John is a bit more quiet and really goes out of his way to try and meet guest needs. Seasha is feisty colorful and involved in a fascinating art project at Burning Man. She is a great cook and was not a """"burning woman"""". She did NOT burn the amazing chocolate chocolate chip cookies that I ate three of. If you like to meet people when you travel especially if you are from abroad and want an authentic and memorable Austin experience this is an ideal place to stay. They gave me lots of tips on places to eat and things to do and Seasha spent about an hour making a map and printing it out showing the location of everything I was interested in. Wow! However John and Seasha left me totally alone when I closed the door to my room so I am sure guests who prefer autonomy and privacy will get what they need. The house is clean very comfortable and well appointed and decorated in an interesting and artsy style. John and Seasha  did a lot of the work themselves. I don't know why anyone would stay in a hotel when they could have all the amenities plus Plus PLUS. (Great hosts super dogs full kitchen patio with an outdoor open air canopy bed books use of living room and dining room washer and drier free parking cable internet...During your stay they will either cook you a homemade breakfast or order you breakfast tacos.

I had the pleasure of staying in this awesome studio for 13 nights where Julia was a wonderful host! It did not feel like she wasn't around a tad bit as communicating with her was very easy and she followed up within 24 hours with answers and suggestions to all my queries. I highly recommend her studio as she has a fully loaded kitchen bathroom and living room with all appliances and luxuries! Absolutely a much better choice than living in a hotel suite! I would love to stay again at her place :),3/31/2013,3432323,Julia,3962770,675759,SXSWDowntown studio uptown finishes,1,Harsh,54001388
We were really just looking for an affordable place to stay that was close to the 6th street action and Aimee's place was perfect. It was exactly as described and perfect for our trip. Aimee was incredibly accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed. Make sure you read her description of how the place is set up rather than just looking at photos because there are some that will make this place not ideal for everyone. But if you're ok with no door on the bathroom and climbing a ladder to a lofted bed then you'll have a great experience just as we did!,3/31/2013,437941,Aimee,3959243,622062,Artist Studio in Downtown Austin,1,Denise,54001389
Such a fun cheerful little cottage!  We could tell a lot of creative effort had gone into the decor.  Lovely.  The lake is just a short walk away and if you walk past the I35 bridge on the path you can find cheap kayak rentals (and other random water vessels).  Fiona and Brian were very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  Definitely recommended.  (We were too lazy to do the full walk to 6th street so we drove halfway and parked for free.

Joey and Steph are the kindest people ever! I had an awesome experience staying at their guest home in Austin TX. The home was immaculate and very clean. They were accessible and always checked in to see if we needed anything at all. They were even nice enough to have the fridge and kitchen fully stocked with breakfast treats and everything you would need to make it through your stay. They had only the best amenities like soap shampoo conditioner body wash in the house. Plenty of fresh towels and extra pillows were available. I would definitely recommends staying here to all my friends.

Michael and his brother were really nice and helpful hosts. The rooms in the house are spacious nicely decorated & very clean. While the living room and kitchen are a bit small we still managed to have a little pre-party at the house before going downtown since the backyard is huge. Michael even told us we could rent a jumpy castle from the shop down the street if we wanted bc the yard is so large. =) The location is fabulous bc it is only a short walk from downtown and the river. We did have a minor problem when my friend dropped a hot coal and burned a hole in the rug when taking it out to the hookah. The host was understanding and let me compensate him directly and fairly and didn't let this incident ruin his perception of my group.

My wife and I were in Austin to attend the wedding of a friends' son at the Lady Bird Johnson Wild Flower Center.  They were providing transportation so we wanted a place close to the boarding area which was in Hyde Park.  It is a quaint lovely area populated by beautiful old  homes of all sizes and shapes.  Pete Gilcrease's Cozy Bright Hyde Park Guest House was a perfect match for us.  Clean and comfortable with parking behind the house is  very convenient. We were both pleased with the mattress which felt much like our Temperpedic at home.  When I had a problem figuring out the TV Pete came over and showed me how it worked.  Within a few blocks are a local  grocery store and a couple of good restaurants that we enjoyed.

Lindsay and her partner were wonderful to work with. The house is  spacious beautiful & very clean. We actually had our rehearsal dinner here and used the beautiful and well-kept backyard for the wedding rehearsal. We agreed in advance to end the party by 10 pm so as to not disturb the people staying in their guest house. The hosts are very respectful understanding and helpful. They even let me stay a few hours after check-out time to use the washing machine in the garage on our last day since their next guests wouldn't be arriving until the next day. The location is fabulous & the entire neighborhood is filled with really nice houses & is only a short walk from SoCo & some lovely parks.

"""Sadly we were not able to take our vacation due to illness in my boyfriend's family.  I made the attempt on multiple occasions to reach out and try to resolve a refund or credit with this host to no avail.  I also made multiple attempts to resolve with airbnb and was told I would have to notify the host directly for her to lift her """"strict"""" cancellation policy.  (Which she did not)  I have now gone back and forth with both for a month with no resolution. It was very disappointing to be out nearly $400 due to an extenuating circumstance that could not be helped.  I understand hosts need to keep their rentals occupied but I notified her directly several days before of the situation.  At the time I thought she was genuinely concerned but I was wrong.  I feel like anyone with a conscious or kids would have been kind enough to at least offer to reschedule our dates.

"""Joe is a top of the line host and makes every effort to help you and walk you through the process. The pint sized pad puts you at a great location. You are literally a block away from SoCo in a quiet street. You have The Crow Bar a block away which we made our last stop of the day every day. There are bus stops nearby on SoCo if you don't want to walk downtown (but it is totally walkable) and you have plenty of eating and shopping choices nearby. The pad itself is the perfect place to unwind and relax after getting your healty dose of walking wonderful Austin. The place is nicely decorated and modern. The bed is very comfy and bedding fresh you have a small kitchenette with everything you need in case you want to cook a little something and lots of fresh towels (really LOTS!).

A perfect spot for those looking to explore and experience all that Austin has to offer! Super convenient and easy walking distance to S. Congress and 1st. Depending on your penchant for getting places on foot also within fairly easy walking distance to downtown. Location was our priority for this trip and I don't think we could possibly have found a better one. The house accommodated the 5 of us quite comfortably with one person on the comfy sleeper sofa.

"""Overall for the price the Hideaway served its purpose for us and was fine. It is quite a bit farther from the action on South Congress than we would have liked but the bus was a easy way to get down there. Crow Bar at the end of the street where the Hideaway is located is a great starting/ending point for an evening out on the town. We rented bikes as an alternative to get downtown but be warned - it's an intense bike ride back home - uphill all the way. Amenities in the Hideaway were adequate. There *IS* a hairdryer so you can save your suitcase space and the steamer/iron thing is the tiniest little device you've  ever seen so don't plan on doing any major maintenance. The wall-unit air conditioner in the bedroom is pretty noisy at night we had to turn it off to keep from waking up every 20 mins.",4/2/2013,,,4000900,224956,,1,Lauren,54001456

Spent a long weekend @ Melissa & Bill's place. It really was perfect for what we were looking for! The hosts were available but not intrusive the neighborhood was quiet but still close to all retail & food needs and there is even decent hiking trails that get you to the greenbelt without needing to drive anywhere! The loft had everything we needed (even an ironing board & iron). The bath tub is big enough for two & the shower head is high enough that I didn't have to hunch over to wash my hair. The dogs are big & very gentle. Really - everything was as they presented it. Bill even went out of his way to make sure we had the latest weekly magazines with local eatery reviews since he knew we wanted to dine out quite a bit.

I'm hesitant to let anyone know how fantastic my 86 year old mother and I found Georgia's place since I want to go there again and I want it to be available when I try and book it. From the outside it looks like a plain Jane house but inside it has been lovingly renovated and has fun original and stylish decor with many vintage finds enlivening the atmosphere. (Great idea to upholster office chairs with vintage fabric and use them at a breakfast table!) The place has many little luxuries like granite counter tops a big flat screen TV and a super shower head and it is spotlessly clean and well appointed. The linen closet with rolled towels and toiletries is a wonder to behold! There was white wine and frosty chilled glasses in the fridge red wine chips and salsa on the sideboard and a really nice well appointed  kitchen that we enjoyed cooking breakfast in. There were all sorts of nice soaps creams and shampoos even soap with a hole in it (to avoid leftover soap slivers) which I had never seen. Georgia thoughtfully included a hangover kit which we were happy not to need and polar fleece blankets on the backs of the outdoor chairs. When she heard that I was a light sleeper she left off a sleep/ambient noise machine and extra earplugs. (There were some in the hangover kit too.) She also came by to take a rental wheelchair we had dropped off inside. The beds were really good- newer pillow top mattresses with nice bedding. If you like my elderly Mom like hard beds the twin bed in one room and the sofas are harder. If you are in a group the living room doors close so you actually could use this as a four bedroom. There are two sofas and a room with two beds so this place would sleep 6 without sharing a bed or sleeping on the floor. I'm hoping to return and get a bunch of girlfriends to rent the house together. I would REALLY like to run away for home and live in this house just the way it is PERMANENTLY. Alas I only had two nights in this wonderful place. I would at least like Georgia to come decorate MY house. The only downside is that there is traffic noise from a major highway about a block away. There are chickens and outdoor cats in the neighborhood as well. None of this should bother you because there is central AC and you can have the windows shut at night. I used the sleep/noise machine and slept beautifully and my Mom slept fine without it.,4/3/2013,3475096,Georgia,4022005,892618,Comfortable home close to Downtown,1,Julie,54001471

Lester was literally the best AirBnB experience I've ever had. I was in town for a wedding and he literally helped turn the entire weekend into an amazing party. He's incredibly nice and outgoing and a lot of fun to hang out with. Most importantly he was so helpful with any questions I had about the city and he lives in literally one of the best neighborhoods there. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I come to Austin. If you're looking for an amazing guide to the city and a genuinely nice person you can't go wrong with Lester.

We so enjoyed our stay at this lovely little guest house!  The hosts were wonderful and the location was so ideal.  The living space and small kitchen is extraordinarily efficient delightfully modern and had everything we needed.  We even loved the packs of maple oatmeal and espresso options the hosts had ready for us.  Access and parking was very convenient.  Our children enjoyed the space inside and outside surroundings very much but we had to be mindful of our youngest daughter occasionally trying to escape up the loft ladder (easily closed off by a door so it wasn't a big problem).

My wife and I stayed at Jacob's apartment this past weekend and we couldn't have been happier.  The location just can't be beat and everything is within walking distance so there is really no need to have a car and there are a ton of bars and restaurants in the neighborhood.  From the airport we decided to take the shuttle bus into downtown which only costed us $1 each took 20 minutes  and dropped us off about 2 blocks from the apartment.  The apartment also offers great views of the Capital building which is nice.  The apartment was very clean which is important for us.  Also the convenience of being able to walk outside in the matter of seconds is priceless no waiting for elevators or going up flights and flights of stairs.  Jacob was a great host and was more than responsive.  He was able to answer all of my questions in a timely manner and I still had a few questions for him when I arrived at the apartment such as the internet password.  Overall Jacob couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  The keyless entry is great and easy too.

If you want to get some sleep then this is perhaps not the place for you as it is on a very noisy street with party goers and bus noises all through the night. If you are young and enjoy the bar scene then maybe this will work for you.  The toilet ran all night and we were concerned about leaving the rental car out in the neighbourhood.  There is no outside light so it was a bit difficult to get the key in the door at night. There is no television or radio. On a positive side the beds were really comfortable and Andi left some refreshments in the fridge which we really appreciated.

She's super quick to respond if you have any questions and even helped me find cheaper Greyhound tickets when I was searching for options on how to get to Austin from NOLA. Her home is in a safe neighborhood and a short walk to cool vintage clothing store bars and a convenience store and a short one bus ride to downtown.

Tracy was a wonderful host.  She was very accommodating with my schedule and prompt with her responses to my questions.  She is very knowledgeable about the city and even offered her reusable cloth grocery bags for me to use because of the Austin ban on plastic bags.  Her zen cabin is perfect for one person traveling to Austin.  It was so much fun to stay there.  Very clean organized and relaxing - exactly what I needed.  The garden around the cabin was a wonderful place in which to sit and read.

When I visit Austin again I look forward to staying at Daniel's Festival Suite. Daniel is a helpful and gracious host. He went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Dan was a great resource with information about his neighborhood and Austin in general. Dan's home is in an excellent location in the very desirable south Austin neighborhood known by its zip code - 78704. The home is within a 5-to-15 minute drive from everywhere a tourist or visitor will want to go which is very important in Austin. The home has easy access to two major north/south streets - Lamar and Congress - plus three major east/west streets - Oltorf Riverside and Cesar Chavez. These streets provide easy access to downtown and central Austin plus convenient access to major freeways including Mopac (Rt.1) Interstate 35 and the Ben White Expressway (Rt. 71.) The Festival Suite is well laid out comfortable and spacious. The suite has a private entrance a beautiful private bath a kitchenette and the bedroom does double duty because of the murphy bed. The room makes a comfortable bedroom when the bed is folded down. With the bed folded up the room is a pleasant living area with a desk dining table and sofa.

Lisa is an excellent communicator and host. She was very open to answering questions. The place is adorable. Although it has two beds it would not be comfortable for two couples to stay because one bed is in a room shared with the living room (has no door or wall).  It was great for a family with younger more flexible kids because the second bed is a blow up and not solid for those with bad backs. Overall the place was great. Such an amazing location quiet and safe. I went on many runs in the area and found that there was much to explore there in Zilker. She has the most unique decorations and makes you feel at home. If all you want to do is read don't worry- she has plenty of magazines and every best seller ever sold. The kitchen is very small but has all the amenities except a microwave. There is no kitchen table but there is a lovely deck for the condo building with a patio table for dining. She welcomed us with a bottle of champagne and plenty of beer! The bathroom was nice but it is in the bedroom and therefore access for night bathroomers is challenging. Internet is fast and TV was great.

What a gem!  My husband and I just wanted an easy getaway from the city and this fit the bill perfectly.  It's so secluded and beautiful yet only 10-15 minutes to the City to grab dinner and hit up farmers markets.  The cabin was meticulously clean and the decor and layout was very relaxing.  Having morning coffee and afternoon beers on the back porch overlooking the hill of Oak trees and roaming cattle was absolutely wonderful.  Having a fully equipped kitchen was fantastic for making breakfast- especially since the kitchen was actually bigger than the one we have at home!  :)  The loft bed was comfortable and cozy but my sneezing fits make me think the pillows were made of a feather/down blend (so if you're allergic be sure to bring an alternative).  Plenty of storage and a nice full shower- better than most local hotels.  The only thing missing was a radio or iPod player.. but thank goodness we had an old 8track radio in the trunk of the car since it made the porch sitting a little more entertaining.  Will be recommending this to all of our Austin friends who just want an easy weekend escape.,4/15/2013,4770686,Adam,4163430,895403,The Little House on the Hill,1,Amelia,54001642

"""What a great place to stay in Austin!  The interior of the Spartanette has been beautifully restored and modernized with lots of thoughtful touches.  It's clear that a lot of thought was put into making the Spartanette a good comfortable place to stay as opposed to just being slapped together on the cheap in order to make a quick buck on tourists.  Sara our host was very hospitable and was able to provide some good local knowledge and recommendations.  The property is great; the Spartanette is located in a very large backyard and the neighborhood is very quiet at night.  That combined with a super comfy bed in the Spartanette = good sleeping.  Everything was as described on airbnb; there were no unpleasant surprises.  I'd highly recommend the Spartanette as a very """"Austin"""" place to stay - and way more interesting and charming than a typical bland hotel room.

Fantastic location for downtown access.  Accommodations were basic but comfortable and clean.  The main room was a bit tight for four people but it worked Hosts were very responsive overall.  BUT - The only way to lock the door from either the inside or out was with a key.  DANGEROUS in emergencies and inconvenient at best since there weren't enough keys for each of our party to have one.  A bat got in through the loft vent on the 2nd night there and all hell broke loose.  Owner is a good person and will probably fix the lock issue but I'd make sure before I committed to staying there.,4/15/2013,1654178,Erik & Crystal,4164143,323733,4th St Loft in Downtown Austin!,1,John,54001646

Staying at Cindy's place was great! It's a perfect location for exploring the hip East side of Austin and is about a 15 minute walk to all the good stuff in downtown and on 6th street. There's no shortage of things to do in the immediate area though and its proximity to Franklin BBQ (about 5 minutes away go early and get in line!) is a plus. Cindy was a great host and was always available if we had questions. The one small issue was the bikes. There are technically 5 bikes but only 3 of them are functional. With a group of 4 people we had to abandon plans to bike around but for a smaller group it wouldn't be a problem.

I spent four days in Austin to wrap up an audio recording/mixing project. I could not have asked for a better environment than Aimee's place. If you are familiar with loft-style living you'll quickly find the groove here- and the lofted bedroom was a really nice touch. The location is fantastic as you are in close proximity to Whole Foods Town Lake YMCA a number of great restaurants/bars and the general downtown area. If you're looking to party downtown I would like to note that It's a trek from the mayhem on 6th but if you're not averse to hoofing it home it's doable.

The massage therapist of the group brought her table and provided relaxation under the sun and gentle caressing of the breeze in the cozy backyard. The house is not far from the city yet seemingly is in its own cozy world. When not engaged in activities sunbathing by the river walking the paths eating gorgeous food and other Austin must dos we rested comfortably in a place that felt like home.,4/17/2013,15176,Charlie,4192838,776713,Amazing Sunlight-filled House!,1,April,54001697

Even took advantage of the roof top deck to get some Texas tanning in can't do that in San Francisco much. Great TexMex is literally walking distance. The host was even super careful to be quiet when I was napping it was as if he wasn't even there. Parking is easy right out front.

Bungalow is exactly as pictured. It's an adorable roomy place to stay. The amenities make the experience: Sovay provides a travel toothbrush if you've forgotten one a first-aid kit feminine hygiene products and amazing bath gel conditioner and shampoo. She also provides a 30-item list of places to eat city attractions and practical tips which led me and my gentleman caller straight to some of the best barbeque we've ever had (thanks Sovay!). This place was an excellent home base for me and said gentleman caller when we were visiting Austin and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay near the center of Austin. It's less than ten minutes from South Congress and downtown. The only cons are parking-related: there's just one parking space for Bungalow guests so if you have multiple cars be prepared to park five or so minutes away in the residential area. And the parking lot at Salon Sovay is extremely small and cramped and awkward to back out of since it's on a fairly busy street. Still relatively minor issues if you'll be out and about most of the day. All in all a very pleasant experience.

The loft is absolutely lovely. The outside is so beautiful as well. The loft is within walking distance of a few different hiking trails and Bill and Melissa were kind enough to provide us with a map and directions on how to find the best trails. They were also able to direct us to the nearest grocery store and local restaurants. The grocery store was only about a 3 minute drive and downtown Austin was less than 15 minutes away. This is a great location lots of privacy yet still close enough to the city. Bill and Melissa were wonderful hosts and the loft was wonderful.

I enjoyed my stay here.  They were able to get the place ready at a very last minute's notice in the evening.  Very friendly and hospitable.  I was able to come and go at any time (that was one of my concerns for one of these places) cab rides from here to downtown are $12-13/ about 10-15 minutes ride.  Their dogs are very playful and friendly but they have their own section in the house if you're not into cute lil pups coming up to greet you.  I'm not sure if this is all year-round but they have a set of christmas lights on the porch so that you can find your way back to the house easily that was very useful.  I recommend this to anyone that's looking to try something different from a hotel but still wants to be close to downtown Austin.,4/23/2013,2598330,Julia & Tom,4278498,959733,Cozy fun home near downtown & UT,1,Alberto,54001829

My wife her mum and I landed in Austin late in the evening but when the taxi delivered us to Mary's place we instantly felt at home in her clean! tidy house. The beds were comfortable linens fresh and high quality and the kitchen had everything Teri needed to cook up a Texas storm. We were hungry when we arrived and didn't realize the 24-hour HEB grocery was so close so we scooted across the street and met the excellent Javier at El Tacorrido. He and his coworker - we didn't catch her name - fixed us up with tasty Mexican food and Texan hospitality. They stayed open a few minutes later just to serve us their last customers of the day. We had a great night's sleep and awoke the next morning eager to investigate Austin. As we'd decided to pick up a car when leaving we were thrilled with the terrific bus service available 100 feet from Mary's door. We bought $2 all-day ride passes an excellent value and spent our time in Austin checking out the Capitol the Blanton Museum the O. Henry House the funky shops and booteries on South Congress Whole Foods' flagship store the quirky G'raj Mahal (delicious Indian food) and the Austin City Limits Theater to see the Gipsy Kings. On our last morning in Austin Teri and I walked downtown in less than an hour to the Hertz location on E. 10th and were very happy to meet Tim who fixed us up with a nice rental car at a great rate. The people we met during our time in Austin were friendly and helpful to a person no matter how casual our encounter. Austin is a wonderful town full of interesting welcoming folks such as Mary our Airbnb hostess. Mary was quick and clear in all our communication and renting her place got our vacation off on the right foot. I can't say enough good things. Thanks very much Mary! We look forward to staying with you again some time.",4/26/2013,,,4304330,104386,,1,Teri,54001895

To say that they went above and beyond to ensure that our first trip to Austin was as pleasant and easy as could be would be a severe understatement.

The guesthouse has everything you need: comfy bed small stovetop and even some local Austin brews already chilled in the fridge!

Downtown Oasis was a lovely little spot for us.  It was a bit away from the heart of downtown meaning my husband took a $7 cab to his meetings at a hotel downtown.  But as a result it was very quiet and private.  The neighborhood was nice and I walked to downtown on a casual stroll.  The apartment was very clean and well equipped. Alexis left us a welcome message as well as little treats in the fridge and on the kitchen counter. Also provided is a wonderful binder of things to do in the area along with copies of maps we were free to take with us.  Though we never actually met Alexis she was easy to reach via text messaging. The apartment sleeps two comfortably. A fold down futon in the living area sleeps two more but maybe children would be better than a second couple as there would be little privacy.

I would love to learn more about their community projects and chat about gardening with them.  Next year we'll be back and I hope to engage with them more.

The instructions to get into the backyard and cottage were really easy to follow. Once inside there was plenty of room. I found the mini fridge to be beneficial being that I usually have leftovers from dining out. Also it was convenient for our drinks! The courtyard area was great for relaxing. We were able to come and go as we pleased without worrying about disturbing Sara.  This made it easy not having to schedule times to meet up and exchange the keys for check-in and check-out. She was a good host and able to be contacted if anything was needed. She even sent me a nice little welcoming message. I highly recommend staying here if you'll be visiting Austin.

This is truly a gem.  Extremely comfortable for either two couples one couple or two singles.  Susan is extremely responsive to every need you have and pays lots of attention to logistics.  The guesthouse is very pretty -- exactly like the photos but better.  Feels more like an upscale B and B (no breakfast but lots of other stuff) than a house for rent. Luxurious and comfortable beds. Extremely clean.. Upstairs has a wonderful balcony and birds abound. Conveniently located but in a neighborhood that is quiet and interesting. Susan also sought feedback on how to make this experience even better which was very sweet and shows how much she cares about her guests.

The hosts were very nice and accommodating considering we arrived 2 hours earlier than expected.  The bedroom is well represented by the picture the bed very comfortable and the bathroom small but well done.  Great shower!  However the accommodations were still a disappointment for one really big reason.  The smell in their house is close to unbearable.  It's painful to be so blunt but I think necessary.  When you walk in you are in a big open space.  It should be a living room but it not used for that.  But what greets you is the pungent smell of animal urine.  They were open about having a small pig and a dog.  But there are more animals than than (including an adorable mini goat) that live IN the house.  And it smells like it.  The bedroom's smell is much less strong but definitely there.  I couldn't sleep because my nose was burning from the ammonia smell.

We recently attended a conference at the Hilton in Austin. I had originally booked three rooms at the Hilton for my employees and myself. I happened to stumble upon Steve's condo listing and thought that would be a great way to save money. I did indeed save money but if I had to do it over again I would pay double for Steve's condo! It is smack dab in the middle of everything. It was so close to our conference that we could literally leave the condo walk to the Hilton and be sitting down faster than someone staying at the Hilton if they had to take the elevator!

I felt like I was transported back in time when I walked into the Caravan. There were deep colors and plush fabrics on the    seating and walls antiqued wooden floors vintage cabinetry and a collection of old records and a record player to set the tone. The owner Mickie thought of everything and there wasn't a place where her attention to detail fell short.

There are large windows all around and I could control my privacy by pulling the shades when I wanted.  The huge metal table in the kitchen was a perfect place for me to work at my computer and to sit and draw.  The small ledge out the back door was a perfect place for me to enjoy my morning coffee: nice and shaded.  Steve was such a great host who left yogurt granola and orange juice for my refreshment so nice!  The photos don't do it justice it is a great place to stay for 1-2 people.  When I come back through Austin I will be looking to see if the cottage is available because I enjoyed my stay so much.,5/15/2013,5620519,Steve,4619509,1021139,Backyard Cottage in Central Austin,1,Nikki,54002215

This was my first time using airbnb and Dustee set the bar pretty high! The apartment was really nice and clean room was cozy and had everything I needed. The location is dangerously convenient since it's walking distance from all the cool places like Whole Foods/Waterloo/Book People and then you'd want to go there every day. It's also really easy to get around since it's on a major road and there's quite a lot of buses going around. Dustee is super nice and accommodating and her cat Gracee is amusing to say the least.

The Cozy Casita was absolutely wonderful!  I could not have been happier.  Dolina is the perfect host and the space is quite magical filled with light beautifully designed perfectly appointed with artwork and attention to detail.  Super comfy bed lots of towels peaceful and quite and perfectly climate controlled.  I was greeted by Donina's husband Yohan who was warm and welcoming and ready to give me any guidance I needed.  There were fresh cherries and a beautiful orchid next to the keys and information sheet.  Dolina messaged me the day before my arrival to ask if I preferred coffee or tea in the morning and how I took it.  My preference was there waiting for me.  I had all the privacy I needed as well.  I met Dolina and her sweet lab Lucy as I was packing to leave.  Awesome folks and an awesome place.,5/15/2013,82762,Dolina,4611522,69810,Cozy Casita Near Downtown in SoCo,1,Wendy,54002222

The apartment has a great location and is well appointed.  Six of us were quite comfortable.  Chris was out of the country at the time but his friend George was very helpful and accessible.  The only negative which is only a temporary situation is that there was absolutely no closet space since Chris is in the process of moving stuff from another location and it was all stored in the apartment.  The only other negative is the proximity to I-35 so there is a quite a bit of traffic onoise at night.

It's true Tiny House is the perfect Austin retreat! Excellent location and an easy walk through a quiet residential area to the lively strip of South Congress - bars food trailers shopping and a view straight to the Capitol. Everything was clean and comfortable with room to spare. In addition to all of the household amenities Amy left a copy of the Austin Chronicle which helped us get our musical bearings and she recommended several spots and neighborhoods to check out.

There is also a BBQ place at the end of their street which we tried and thought was really good. But we had the best BBQ experience with Tom smoking us brisket for dinner we loved it!!

Also close is access to the running/walking trails that circle Lady Bird/Town Lake. If you're a runner bring your shoes. Cabs are scarce on this side of 6th.

This house is amazing. We had a great time lounging on the roof playing music in their great room cooking huge vegan soul food dinners in the gorgeous kitchen and passing out in the 3 comfortable bedrooms. We were a group of 8 and stayed for 4 nights and only ever had about 6 people staying there at a time so it was quite comfortable. The rain shower in the master bath was a big hit too. And when we left the house we found ourselves in perfect walking distance to all of my favorite east side haunts. The Liberty The White Horse Papi Tino's. And the newest addition to the neighborhood Whisler's which has a huge outdoor area and amazingly inventive cocktails. Reminded me of Volet Hour in Chicago or Little Branch in NYC. Lastly Kim was such a great host! So very flexible with our check-in /out times answered questions immediately when we needed something and the house was well stocked with essentials (her espresso machine makes delicious coffee and she left us plenty to use).

The bathroom was furnished with plush towels and luxurious spa items for our stay better than any hotel amenities I have ever used. The kitchen was stocked with ice water bottles treats and red bull for our use. The bedrooms are gorgeous as well and both beds were spacious and extremely comfortable. It is nice that there are two floors with a bedroom on each floor so you can have separate spaces for your companions. The location and neighborhood in Austin is perfect and a cab ride to down town only costs around 11 dollars.

"""Oh my goodness. I wish I could rate our stay as a 100 STAR experience! You will find no greater area with more charm whimsy or oozing with such love & warmth! We fell in love with Sara & Jay from Portland! We loved their asethetic and they lived in a similar neighborhood with a similar lifestyle as we do here in our neighborhood in Portland so we felt completely at HOME! Sara was amazing! She was so keenly aware of making sure that that spacious backyard and patio in front of the Spartanette was so peaceful secluded and it felt like it was just us! However our only regret on our trip was not to have been able to spend more time with them! They gave us amazing recommendations! When we met Austinites they were so impressed with where we were staying when we showed them pictures! Austinites were even writing down her info to book stays there! The Spartanette was spacious and felt roomy yet cozy! The bed was SO amazing! The  sheets felt like hotel quality! TONS of storage space so your floor space is free! The bathroom was FAR more spacious than it looks! The shower was amazing! Great pressure! And my 6'4"""" husband never had an issue with height inside the Spartanette ever! Sara had freshly ground coffee waiting in our kitchen area with honey & sugar beer in the fridge and cream for coffee! Don't worry about the rooster I barely noticed him awaking the day...and their dogs are so sweet and don't really have a lot of personal contact with people...they keep to themselves so if you're nervous of dogs don't be of these two brothers!! The couch and TV area was totally unexpected and amazing! They even had saved shows and movies you were able to watch! BONUS: They had the latest Game of Thrones for us to keep up with! SCORE! So rad!!! The fridge and microwave made it awesome to chill around the Spartanette and not needing to go out for every meal! The Wet Whistle Grocery nearby is amazing & quirky! The 24 hr. cafe nearby had amazing Banh Mi Sandwiches and of course caffeine! We loved the neighborhood! Not with downtown douchbag-types...just with SUPER RAD Austin folks! Took us only 5 or so minutes to get most places we went! The air conditioning worked well! We were never uncomfortable! Even had an extra fan too! This place MADE our stay in Austin what it was!!! BEST DECISION EVER! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We'll be back for sure!!! With our kid! {smile} THANK YOU SARA & JAY! YOU'RE SUPER RAD FOLKS!!!!!

"""Please do yourself the favor of staying at this lovely guest home in Zilker. I really loved it. I was there for a week on business and this place offered ideal quiet space comfort and location.

The home is nestled behind the main house has its own little path lined with wildflowers separated from the rest of the property. It is beautifully put together the bathroom/shower/etc is clearly brand new and I loved the soap... (it's about the little things after all :-) Esteban and Maria were wonderful hosts...flexible and present... but offering lots of privacy.

Stayed here on a family vacation.  The owners are great people and were very helpful with our stay in Austin. The guest house is in a great location as it is close to shopping grocery stores and multiple bus lines within walking distance.  The guest house is located close to the University of Texas and is only a 5 or 10 minute bus ride to downtown the Capital South Congress and Zilker Park.  The house is just the right size for two people on vacation and is well furnished and nicely decorated.  Overall the house is great I would stay here again.  That being said there was a down side; the kitchen isn't well stocked if you're planning on doing any cooking during your stay.  A spatula and knife were the only cooking utensils and though there are some mixing bowls and sauce pans for the stove it lacked pans and bake-ware for the oven.  But since Austin is a Foody town loaded with restaurants finding a place to eat out isn't a problem. I would recommend the Wild Wood Bakehouse for those who are gluten free.  I give the guest house 4 out of 5 stars.,5/26/2013,475506,Dan,4790715,145210,Maiden Lane Guesthouse,1,Mike,54002417
Steve's place was great.  Very well done aesthetically pleasing easy walk to the University and or Downtown if you are a walker.  I did call a cab one day it was there in ten minutes.

One day it rained heavily and Steve brought me an umbrella which was really a lifesaver. If you're headed to Austin you should stay at Steve's if you are not headed to Austin you should really think about it amazing food cheap drinks really friendly people.

I'm forever thankful to Elizabeth and David for letting me stay in their home. I relocated to Austin from Alabama and stayed here for 1 1/2 months during my transition period. I didn't know anyone in Austin but Eliz. & David made sure to keep me involved with their fun activities. From moment one I felt like I had a two good friends. I ran into many tough obstacles getting on my feet in Austin and they were there to lift me up every time I fell. The house is nestled into a really nice area. It's quite convenient and relaxing. Although the house is great the best asset to this place is Elizabeth and David. They are two of the kindest helpful and warm-hearted people you will ever meet. That said they are COOL and ALWAYS on a new adventure. If you're hesitating about renting this place just do it. You won't regret it. If it weren't for Elizabeth and David I would probably be back in AL right now. Thanks for everything!,5/26/2013,8186,Elizabeth,4794470,5769,NW Austin Rooms,1,Chris,54002420

"""Generally speaking the apartment was a convenient place to crash for a fun girl’s weekend in Austin. The apartment was a decent size for a two bedroom (though not big enough for a group of 7) and Christian was very responsive during the booking process and only a text message away if needed.  We could see certain personalities enjoying this apartment but this was not what we were hoping for. We had the impression the apartment was a vacation rental but the apartment was actually Christian’s primary residence (maybe our fault for not clarifying) in a huge residential complex. The bedrooms were extremely cluttered with boxes and duffle bags; closets were full of boxes books and an extra mattress; other personal items cluttered up the living room and there was leftover food in the fridge. While the apartment appeared to have clean sheets and a plethora of clean towels the apartment was not nearly as clean as a hotel would be.  There was a layer of dust on most of the furniture.  The worst offense though was that the showers were not cleaned and he left considerable amounts of bath products in them such as loofahs and a squeegee. All of this could be fixed by a good scrub from professional cleaners.",5/28/2013,,,4829576,321857,,1,Elizabeth,54002467
We stayed with Matt at the recommendation of a friend who rented the studio last year. His main house was full so he gave us a room in his second house.

He was out of town during our stay but answered all of the questions we had via text including the location of a spare clean towel:) Would totally stay with him again.,5/28/2013,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt,4853205,256464,A Baby suite on SoCo in room bath,1,Gaylia,54002468

We had from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning in town and it was so easy to get to anything we wanted to do.  It's a mere 2 minute walk down a little hill to get to the bustling area of Barton Springs road where you have your pick of food and drink spots a 10 minute beautiful walk over to the Lamar Bridge to watch the bats and a quick jaunt to Barton Springs pool.  The Suite Spot was our little oasis and the first night we ended up having a bottle of wine on the patio after we made it back from dinner.  We never got to meet John but Amber was very friendly and efficient and made sure we knew to just ask if we needed anything.

GREAT experience.  The bungalow was so unique and beautiful all the amenities you could want very clean spacious.  It was ideal too because I had my dog with me and after his morning walks he hung out in a swanky little house all day happy as a clam- it's hard traveling with pets so I always appreciate places that are truly pet friendly.  Trudy was great very welcoming and gave suggestions for food locally.  The location is pretty central to Austin for those that may want to split time between downtown Arboretum and the Round Rock area.  I would love to stay again (but mostly I would love to just rent it forever and make my review moot).,5/30/2013,6201968,Trudy,4881047,1130450,CHERRYWOOD BUNGALOW in East Austin,1,Cristina,54002534

This Airstream is truly a gem. Me and my girlfriend only stayed for one night but it was a very enjoyable place to stay. The garden Marcella has crafted as well as the animals makes for a great atmosphere. Little details inside the Airstream were a great touch (loved the comics on the bathroom wall!) the toffee was delicious water jug much appreciated and the place was very comfortable. All amenities were just as she described full working bathroom comfortable bed and it was nice and cool inside with the A/C (in case anyone was worried about staying cool in the summer we had the place COLD). All in all a great experience. We will definitely be staying gain in the future. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique comfortable affordable place to stay in Austin.

Jamie's condo in Austin was a fantastic find! We travelled from Australia with two children aged 4 and 6 and this was a great place to base ourselves.

Seven family members stayed in Steve's condo while visiting Austin for our daughter's wedding.  The condo was clean comfortable and in a great location downtown.  Starbucks just across street at the Marriott.  There was some street noise on weekend nights sirens from the nearby fire station but we would have had that in a hotel as well.  We are walkers and found it a quick walk to river sixth street nightlife restaurants etc.  We also had a rental car in our group and it was close to freeway access to visit other attractions around Austin.

This spot was just what was needed during a hectic weekend in Austin. Basically the chillest location/accommodations imaginable. The dogs loping about the property chickens cooing in their sweet coop beautifully lit patio for lounging at the end of the day fantastic vegetable and herb garden... and that's all outside. Inside is wonderfully outfitted; the couch and bed are super comfortable there's plenty of room for two people to go about their business without bumping into each other and the fridge provides a pleasant welcome by being stocked w/ Lone Star. Sara was super nice and helpful; even with an extensive flight delay on my end she was able to make sure I got settled in  with a comprehensive walkthrough regarding how everything worked and checked in with me via text during my trip to see if I needed anything. Not a super long walk to downtown if you are a city person used to walking everywhere but would recommend taking a cab back at night.

Gray and Jude were very friendly and accommodating and their place is inviting and cozy. It was easy to come and go as needed with a short walk over the highway via an overpass or to the next block to catch a bus downtown. The loft space wasn't much bigger than the bed but was a comfortable place to rest. I appreciated the hangers and stair-shelves. Be warned that the ladder to the loft is a bit steep in case you aren't agile. The dogs (who very much want some love) leave some hair and soil on the floor.

Edie could not have been more accommodating or endearing.  She opened her home to us and was a warm and attentive host.  The property is amazing.  It is certainly walking distance from food trucks Cenote coffee shop (our breakfast most mornings) and several interesting eats locations.  Drive-wise we were mere minutes from the huge city park complete with stand up paddleboard walking/jogging trails etc.  We ate at Moonshine Cafe which was phenomenal.  Rainey Street night life is nearby and really great for catching live music and cool vibes while you sip on something cold.  It was an incredible trip but the most wonderful part was Edie!!

We had a bachelor party of 9 stay here for the weekend and it was the perfect place to relax and beat the summer heat while close enough to walk to Rainey St 6th St or E. 6th St bars. The pool and the great trees keep the compound much cooler than the rest of the city....great for the summer. The pool is nice and was the focus while we were there the houses did there job.....clean and comfortable with good beds and plenty of air mattresses for a large group.  All 9 of us would certainly stay here again. Yelp will tell you every single restaurant is 4 Stars in the area....you can't go wrong with Las Cazuelas right around the corner for an eclectic and gritty mexican restaurant with huge portions of good food for a few bucks. Tip: bring mosquito repellant/citronella candles for the pool area Austin can be buggy if you're not from mosquito territory ;),6/10/2013,1772568,David,5059064,904354,Rare Wild West-style compound nr DT,1,Hartley,54002683

The apartment was at a fantastic unbeatable location.  We were able to fit 10 girls in there as Chris supplied a few air mattresses.  None of us in the group had been to Austin before and Chris was great at introducing us to the city when we first checked in.  He was so generous and let us use the kitchen supplies and had a lot of extra towels and bedding so that we were all comfortable despite being so many in the space! The apartment has a lot of stuff in it so do not expect lots of room. The condo is in a complex with a pool and a gym so we could lay out and work out if needed which was great.

We were able to sleep 11 comfortably with no problems! Terrance was so quick to respond to me during the whole process price was amazing and they even texted me to check and see if everything was going well during my stay there! We had such a GREAT time and the condo was in the perfect location. So many great restaurants near by and a cab right to 6th street was only $12 which was completely worth it! One night we drove ourselves and it took 5 minutes to get downtown and be surrounded by Austin's greatness! We had so much fun during our stay and their condo could not have been better!

This review comes a wee bit late because frankly I was still mentally in Austin and reality took a bit of time catching up to me. Austin kind of has a way of doing that to a girl. Enough about that; Chris’ place was a wonderful place to stay. Important: everything is as promised and detailed on the site. But what you don’t know (until you get there) is how accommodating and friendly and helpful Chris is upon your stay. He not only picked me up from my hotel but also tipped me off to some great things to do while in town and was always available if I needed anything. This was my first airbnb experience and I genuinely couldn’t ask for more. I’d love to keep his place all to myself but since I can’t I tell you this: do not hesitate in staying at Austinville Cottage.

This is a great place to go if you want to do some cooking because she gives you free reign to cook all you want and use any food she has.  It was nice having our own bathroom too.  It was not within easy walking distance of the 6th Street bars but she does offer the bikes for free and that would be perfect.,6/12/2013,880571,Angel,5102161,329306,Urban Homestead: Bikes + Chickens,1,Hannah,54002727
Thanks AMY ! for a wonderful stay at your Tiny House.  I really appreciated all the extra food items and the very cute place.  It was a great place to relax after being all around town.  Austin was wonderful and had many awesome places to eat.  I even made it to the San Antonio Riverwalk which was charming.  I wish I saw more live music but was able to go to one place Monday night that was great.

This was the perfect house for us! At 8 months pregnant and traveling with our big dog it can often be hard to find comfort on the road but we couldn't have felt more at home. The kitchen was one of my favorite parts of the house where I spent time making meals and doing laundry in the stacked washer and dryer. There were only two of us so the house was much bigger than our needs and it would totally be comfortable for a larger group of friends or family. My dog loved the neighborhood where we went for long walks every night and people in the neighborhood are all so friendly. It's a short walk to S. Congress where you can get ice cream pizza go shopping and more. We couldn't have picked a better place to call home for a week!

The Gypsy Caravan was a great place to stay. Its like having your own private tropical hideaway in the middle of the city.  I was completely comfortable and relaxed there.  All the bamboo in the backyard makes you feel a bit of peace and solitude been then when you are ready you can just leave the fence and be really close to everything in Austin. Mickie was a great host. Checked on me from time to time to make sure I was happy and comfortable.  I am pretty low maintenance so I didn't need much but she made it clear that she would have helped me out with whatever.

She even left us a big umbrella in anticipation of rain. She has a really sweet dog & two cats that hang out in the yard during the day. They stick to themselves in case you aren't an animal person.

We ended up staying at Coleman's place after our other place fell through and he was quick to answer and we were able to get to his place right away which worked out perfectly for us. The place is very spacious and artsy. The bedroom we stayed in was nice and the electricity worked the entire time we were there (almost) with no problems. My only issue was the fact that Coleman leaves the door open all day and night in order to let the breeze in the house because it is solar powered and there are only fans in the house. Because of this there probably lives the entire mosquito population of texas coming in and out of the house.

The ceiling is high in the house so it gives it a very open feel.

"""This place is in a great location. It was just a couple of minutes by car to South Congress where there are lots of places to eat and some """"different"""" places to shop...near 6th St. too.  I say different because it wasn't probably the things I would shop for but I guess this is part of what keeps Austin weird!  Lindsay's place is also very clean and comfortable and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone. The beds and linens were great quality and we slept like babies. This is my first time as an Airbnb user so I was very hesitant to use the site at first because we didn't want to stay in someone's everyday house with all of their stuff.  This place is a true """"rental"""" which is what we were looking for. I did tons of research and read hundreds of reviews before making a reservation. My hubby and I were pleased and so was the other couple who went with us! There were a few little hiccups in the reservation process at first.  The price that was quoted ($190 per night plus $46 for Airbnb fee with cleaning included) when I entered the dates for the place was not the price that showed up when Lindsay agreed to let us book...her original offer ($524) was $100 more for the weekend. When asked about it she didn't know exactly why the price came up to that so she went in and made a second booking price offer ($448) which was still more than what was listed when viewing her place on the site.  After my third message to her she did get the price to be exactly what we were seeing on the site ($426). I'm still not exactly sure how the original offer wasn't a reflection of the price showing on the site but make sure you check prices when booking just to make sure. We also had to ask for more towels (only 3 were left for 4 people for 2 days). I truly think this was just an honest mistake that probably doesn't happen often at all. When I messaged about it we received a call very quickly and towels were brought to us the next morning. It also seems as if the last guest or someone switched some of the wires for the TV and cable around because we couldn't get this to work until my husband checked the cables and realized that they were not plugged in correctly...an easy fix but a little frustrating for a few minutes. Even with these minor occurances we were super happy to stay at this place. You can rest assured that you will be comfortable when you decide to stay at Lindsay's rental!! Just FYI...we loved eating at Kerbey Lane's Home Slice Pizza the Hula Hut the Crepe food truck on S. Congress and Gourdough's Donuts. There were so many other places that I want to try next time we visit.  """,7/1/2013,1710302,Lindsay,5474914,668873,SOCO! Two bedroom on Travis Heights,1,Theresa,54002985
"""Staying at Jason's was definitely one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. The place was beautiful even larger than the pictures indicate and very very clean. Jason was also kind enough to leave coffee plenty of water and great bathroom amenities. The balcony was the perfect place to unwind at the end of the day and the location is great -- not only because of all of the cool places you can easily just walk to but also as a starting point to getting almost anywhere in the city. Additionally Jason was very communicative and friendly from the start provided excellent information and instructions before we arrived and really went out of his way to help us out. I also appreciated that Jason has a """"grown-up"""" kitchen with all that you need to prepare great meals if you choose.

I didn't know what to expect having never used Airbnb before but Lester's house worked out great. He was not home when I arrived but the place was easy to find. It is in a great location a couple blocks off South Congress. Finally met Lester the second night of my stay when we arrived home at 2am. He was very nice and even brought us back some tacos from his late-night taco run - they were delicious. He was never in the way and for the most part felt like had our own house when we were there - although most of the time we were out doing things. The only negative part of our stay is that the back room does not get as good AC as the rest of the house so woke up sweating the first morning - adjusted the thermostat the next night. Overall I had a good experience and would recommend Lester's room.,7/8/2013,236847,Lester,5625262,90898,SOCO One private room in a 2B house,1,Matt,54003118

We had a great stay at Edith's place . Roomy  very close to everything  comfy beds clean  she even had toiletries available in case u ever forget anything . U do need to let her know to adjust the thermostat (which is in the upstairs bedroom ) so she can warm it up or cool it down for u . Maybe a fan in one of the adjacent rooms would have helped  it was at 2am when it felt warm in the room and I just felt embarrassed to wake her to adjust the thermostat . of which we did anyway cause I couldn't sleep .

Kristen's condo was absolutely perfect!  I stayed here for a little over a month to attend a summer intensive class at UT and the location was perfect.  So close to everything!  2 minute drive to downtown 10 minute walk to campus!  Comfy bed large walk in closet lots of counter space and all the necessities needed for a weekend getaway or a long term rental!!  Super close to downtown but located in a nice tree shaded QUIET area!!  Convenient parking underneath the building too and nice front load washers/dryers in the laundry room a few doors over from the unit!!  Kristen was also a great host and great with communication (usually instant responses to any questions I had).  I recommend her and her units to anyone needing a place to stay in Austin and will not hesitate to stay here again!

Her house itself is roomy and clean her dog is an absolute delight and did not make a noise during my whole 3 day stay. As a seasoned host Leslie had a box in my room with a ton of travel essentials ( from shampoo to bug spray to face wash ) which is really thoughtful of her to have put there. Having lived in Austin for well over 10 years she knew all the best spots to go to to drink at  to make friends at and she shared her knowledge freely. Since I am a woman traveling alone she made a ton of time for general small talk and was nice enough to answer my millions of questions ( from general curiosity to """"big"""" 21 year old female dramas ).

What a great place to stay.  Just the right size for a couple or three people to stay as well as to entertain a small group of family or friends in the living room.  Our son and his girlfriend live only several blocks away so the location was perfect them to swing on over.   There's a floor to ceiling glass window that looks out over an attractively landscaped backyard area.  The surrounding leafy neighborhood (Hyde Park) is lovely with a variety of well-kept homes that are pleasing to the eye.  Just three blocks to some cafes eateries and a great grocery story and the 18 to 20 minute walk to the UT campus with all that it offers is very pleasant.  Easily a three-person stay as long as the third person who stays doesn't mind going up the ladder and nestles into the cozy loft area.  The loft is part of and overlooks the bedroom.    We talked to Mark over the phone a couple of times and he responded right away to any questions or requests.

This place was great. Clean well-appointed and comfortable. It was small but still bigger (and likely nicer) than any hotel you could find for a similar price and perfect if you're out and about enjoying Austin anyway and just need a comfortable place to sleep. The location is great right between the campus and the Capitol and Kristen is very helpful and quick to respond to any queries. The parking is free and out of the elements which is also a big plus.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Mickie's trailer. The caravan was utterly enchanting and I never wanted to leave. The little details were fantastic from the art to the local CDs to the coffee. The AC does a reasonable job fighting the summer heat and the deck is a great place to hang out w/friends and a nice glass of wine. I easily paid less than I would have paid for a decent (and boring) motel room.

For our first time using Airbnb my wife and I could not have asked for a better experience. The apartment is exceptionally clean spacious and comfortable. Susan and Anthony were accommodating from start to finish. The location serenity and peacefulness of their place rates 5 STAR PLUS. There was even a Nespresso machine in the room and now I’m hooked!  Susan stayed in touch throughout our stay and was attentive to our questions. Anthony made himself available in person in case we had questions about places to eat visit etc. At the last minute we extended our reservation and Susan practically walked us through the entire process. I would highly recommend renting from Susan and Anthony.  They have certainly set the bar pretty high for our next airbnb stay.

Great location for visiting Zilker Park/Barton Springs. Nicely furnished plenty of kitchen utensils perfectly clean full size fridge stocked w/ condiments; complimentary coffee and toiletry items. I was very pleased with these nice touches. Communication was excellent and timely. She also provided plenty of house notes and Austin magazines.  The apartment itself however is not exactly enchanting IMO. It's tiny; the floor plan is disjointed so feels smaller than it is; the Wi-Fi did not work in the living room on the couch; the lighting is poor; it's generally dilapidated. But the kitchen and bathroom appliances worked well and suited our purpose just fine. I feel we got a good deal.  I'm not sure why it costs extra for a second guest but we were pleased that she waived the extra person fee for our 3 month old.

Their place was very nice clean accommodating and perfect location. I left it very clean with garbage in their trash cans just as expected. I do appreciate the discount they provided very much but later found out they expected the place to be left IMMACULATE because of that (which they failed to communicate to me prior). In the end there was just a break in communication of what both sides expected. I'd stay there again but would just be clear in communicating whats expected during your stay.,8/5/2013,3389824,Raquel + Jacob,6267992,961883,Historical Loft with Capitol View!!,1,Steve,54003450

Gretchen's home was a perfect venue for my introduction to Austin and she was a very accommodating host. The colorful palette and art within the house and playful porch made it difficult to venture beyond the farm fence boundaries. The home was well represented on airbnb in the photos. Even better actually in person. It is an easy bus ride in from the airport and within a nice stroll of the lively SoCo restaurants and shops. Great coffee at Once Over less than a 5 minute walk away. I was also able to go on a nice morning run right out the door reaching the Lady Bird Trail within a mile. All of these conveniences are a major plus but the eclectic decor and perfectly funky porch all added so much to my Austin experience. I hope to return soon to swing on the rope porch-swing sipping a nice local Austin beer listening to Patsy Cline on the radio.

The fan and AC kept the room cool the bed and futon were very comfortable and the shower was super. The wifi worked perfectly and the Netflix on the TV was nice. The only issue was that the door was accidentally locked when we got there so we had to wait a bit for Drew's son to come and open it but he was quick and then politely showed us around. The apartment was easily childproofed for our toddler -- not too much clutter and enough space for him to run in circles.

We always stay at cool funky and unique places whenever we travel.  It's hard to find but I was once again successful.  My daughter and I found this place and surprised my husband with it.  For the first few hours your amazed and cant stop looking.  Lois is very kind and it's hard to talk to her when your senses are in overload while admiring her unique taste and her artwork.  We didn't want to leave but had to because it was booked.  We stayed in Austin for 2 more nights and kept comparing and misses the art zen pad (that's what we called it).  We cant wait to go back!  We went to 3 of Lois's food recommendations and loved all of them especially Magnolia's.  We even went back 2 x to Magnolia's.  The Fun Funky place is extremely relaxing and quiet!   Close to everything!  We even left our 3 locked bikes on our car out front and they were perfect in the morning no one touched them.  A few days later we went to Schlitterbahn and while swimming someone had messed with one of our lights on our bikes but not at Lois's Zen Pad.

There's not much Sevylla doesn't know about Austin or the music scene here - she really is the best intro you could have to the city particularly if you're a musician.  I stayed here for a week and for once couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  I don't drive so had to rely on the buses - not a problem here as they pick up and drop off within a few doors of the studio.  I was in town or back home within a half hour and the 24hr $2 fare was cheap enough to do a few cross-town routes in-between.  The neighborhood was friendly and the store close enough to stock up on beer wine and whatever I needed before heading out into town (generally beer and wine so I was good).  The room was everything you see here - clean private quiet and cool enough to deal with the Texas heat.  You can come and go as you please and Sevylla is only a text away from any advice you might need for whatever you want to get out of your stay in Austin.  I'll certainly be staying here again in future and advise that you book it post-haste if you see a gap in the calendar - I promise you'll not regret it.  A word has to be said about Sevylla herself who was such a warm generous and fun person to meet - a true ambassador for both Austin and Airbnb. If every Airbnb host was of this calibre we'd all be putting hotels out of business.  This is where travel gets way more interesting - meeting local folk who love their town and want to show you the best of it.  Sevylla knows Austin inside out - loves it - and knows far more than the Holiday Inn or the Hilton about how to enjoy the place.

Jackie is a terrific hostess!  Right from the beginning everything went very smoothly.  The registration was easy and Jackie kept us very well-informed sending us detailed directions to the place and giving us great suggestions for things to do while we were in town.  The space was great and just like the pretty pictures in the listing.  Jackie provided all the things that you could think to need for your stay…snacks dishes towels toiletries Scrabble travel cooler Wi-Fi and many more amenities.  The bed was comfortable the water pressure in the shower was great and the air conditioner and fan kept the room nice and comfortable even in the hot 100 degree weather we experienced.  We also really enjoyed having the little patio to hang out and eat our breakfast or afternoon snack and liked having the friendly cats and dog to keep us company on the patio.  Overall we had a great stay and I would definitely recommend the place.,8/24/2013,6216533,Jackie,6763246,1153338,Close in to Dntn Austin Friendly!,1,Lori,54003724

Gretchen was responsive super friendly and really low-key about us coming and going.

My partner and I had an absolutely wonderful time staying with Sevylla in Austin. The place was just as described - easy to find and incredibly clean. It was a perfect place to lay our heads for the two nights we were in town before heading to a wedding. On top of the great digs Sevylla is great company. She is incredibly warm and inviting told us some hot spots to check out and was great with sharing her home and interests with us. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else if we were to visit Austin again. Only 1 tiny drawback was that the internet was a bit spotty. When it worked it was super fast but there were one or two random times when the network just wasn't connecting.

"""This was our first time using Airbnb so I was little worried whether everything would actually turn out ok -- I ended up being pleasantly surprised!  We had a great time at Rachel's guest house. It was a very nice space -- so much nicer than any hotel we could have stayed at for the same price and it really was perfect for a family with young kids. The sofa pulled out into a bed just the right size and height for our almost 3 year old twins to sleep on and there were so many toys for them to play with! They were especially taken with the ride in car and gas pump. They spent hours riding back and forth and """"refiling"""" the gas tank! It was a surprisingly large space and well laid out so the kids had plenty of space to play and burn some energy. There was also a play area outside which they used briefly but it was really too hot to do much outside. The kitchen was just the right size to fix breakfast and we could easily have made a simple lunch or dinner too if we'd been there longer. There were plastic plates cups and utensils for the kids (and normal dishware for the adults) so I didn't have to worry about them accidentally breaking anything. There was even a small table and chairs so they had a comfortable place to sit and eat. Like I said a perfect place for anyone traveling with young kids! The only complaint I had was the queen size bed in the bedroom was very firm... but I didn't notice that complaint in any of the other reviews I read so maybe it's just me.

Overall I had a wonderful time staying at Terrance's house and could not have ask for a better more accommodating host.

If you made it this far you're a few clicks away from booking a great Austin experience.  Michele is a kind and helpful hostess just like all the other reviews say.  Her house is about a block away from an easy bus into the thick of it comfortably distant from the bustle conveniently located for highways and easy to share.  The great thing about the outdoor shower is that it keeps the restroom available - use it!  We've been gone for a week and she is still helping me with textbook deliveries.

What a great place! It is just the right size for one to four people staying for a weekend getaway. The location is so close to South Congress yet it is in a very quiet neighborhood. Right around the corner is a convenient HEB grocery store. When we got there Tony was very welcoming and made sure to show us all the features of the Little Monstrosity. I really liked the lofted bed and the added touch of a climbing a ladder to the private bed was really cool. Tony even provided some speakers for us so that we could play music in the house. The place is clean and private with plenty of room to store your bags and hang your clothing. Parking was always available at all times of the day either on the street or in the driveway. If you don't have a car or just plan on walking or biking everywhere it is very easy to get to the restaurants and bars on 1st street and South Congress from the house. There is even a small and private enclosed courtyard with a table and chairs. For those hot and sunny Texas days there is a very convenient sunshade above the table and chairs to keep you comfortable. If you stay here make sure to get yourself some Gourdough's Donuts or stop by Elizabeth's for an excellent bowl of pho. I would stay here again and again.

Fantastic Experience!  My daughter and I stayed at Tracy's apartment for two weeks as we were relocating to Austin.  Although we had a car with us we didn't need it all the time.  There are restaurants and coffee shops close by.  There is also a nice laundromat within walking distance.  Tracy was a wonderful host.  Even though she was out of town the first few days she was available by phone to answer a couple of questions.  The place was clean and comfortable with a nice decor.  There were basic pantry items so we could easily cook.  Even though we stayed during the hottest time of the year we were kept nice and cool with the two window AC units.  The best part was meeting Tracy when she returned from her trip.  She has a wealth of knowledge about Austin and was such a pleasure to talk to.  She definitely made my daughter and I feel at home.  I highly recommend staying at one of Tracy's apartments!,9/5/2013,4635658,Tracy,7071134,1078,Craftsman 1920 Apt: Hyde Park/UT,1,Rita,54003929
Cenote Studio is just a few blocks from downtown and near many East Austin destinations.  It was nice just being a few steps away from Cenote Cafe which has a really nice outdoor atmosphere  (as long as it is not hotter than hell).  The inside was newly remodeled it was cool inside and it definitely was not outside.  The apartment was stocked with plenty of clean linens and towels.  My only deduction is for overall cleanliness-the floors and countertops were not as clean as I like.,9/5/2013,8014187,Cody,7081853,1499714,Cenote Studio right downtown,1,Brian,54003930

"""The SoCo Cottage was everything we hoped for.  It was close to all of Austin's major highways yet very quiet with no noisy neighbors or noisy traffic.  The bed was super comfortable and the AC worked beautifully even in the three digit heat.  We would have sat outside on the covered porch but it was too hot for us New Yorkers!   The kitchen was well-stocked and we ate all of our breakfasts and a few dinners in.  There was plenty of hot water for our numerous showers and extra towels if we needed them.  We stayed for a week and there was plenty of space for all of our clothes shoes and other belongings.  The WiFi worked beautifully.  We only used the TV a couple of times because we were so busy.  It was great to come """"home"""" and have an assigned parking space close by.  Joe was very patient with me and answered all my questions when I booked the Cottage.  I never did meet him but my husband and I met his wife Bella.  She was very friendly and gracious.  If we ever return to Austin we would not hesitate to stay at the Cottage again.

There's a nifty neighborhood cat that seems to go from house to house making random cameo visits - also cool with rubs and lovins on your way in or out of Leslie's comfy house.

The accommodations themselves are perfect. The air conditioners are quiet and work great (important in the summer in Austin). The bedroom being separate from the living room is really nice - we left our suitcases downstairs and the bedroom upstairs was really uncluttered & calming with a beautiful cedar ceiling. The mini-fridge & microwave are convenient to have too. It's a really well-thought-out new construction that just has good juju.

When we arrived at the Zilker cottage it was even more enchanting than in the photos. The front porch is wreathed in climbing vines and looks oh so welcoming. I wish the interior lived up the exterior charm a little more--it was a fine place made all the better by Sovay's very savvy Austin recommendations and guide she left for us (we felt like we had the inside scoop!) but it was a little dark for our tastes. We tend to like things kind of bright though so if you are okay with a cozier atmosphere this the place for you. Lighting aside the kitchen bedroom and bath had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the shower was good too. There are some great touches--the kitchen has filtered water there are lots of interesting books on the shelf there is a basket of bath goodies for you the aforementioned guides to Austin. Sovay wasn't there but her father was and he was a great host--left us to our own devices unless we needed anything which is perfect in our book.

Cindie Brooks and her Heart of Tarrytown Bed and Bath were the perfect welcome to Austin for me. The room and bath were comfortable and clean. The house is located in a beautiful and safe neighborhood Tarrytown which happens to be within walking distance to a river and several great restaurants along the river. What made my experience the most memorable though was Cindie herself. She is warm welcoming and generous.

This place is exactly what we had in mind for my bachelor party and 2 people that were there with us this past weekend already said they are hoping to rent it for their own bachelor parties. Our group never felt anywhere near cramped (each able to sleep on there own bed or air mattress) and the 3 separate houses arrangement allows for those that want a little more peace and quiet to isolate themselves. Also the main house is big enough to fit 10+ people for an indoor gathering if you need (useful for breakfast for our group) though the outdoor pool/yard space was certainly our favorite attraction.  We never had any problems getting to/from downtown or finding food and David was quick to respond via both airbnb and email when that became necessary. Lastly an oft-overlooked bonus for big groups - there is a gate code to get in so you don't need to worry about everyone in your group not having a key and people getting locked out.,9/16/2013,1772568,David,7329817,904354,Rare Wild West-style compound nr DT,1,Brandon,54004072

There are so many cute returants and bars in the immediate area. We had a great lunch at cenote on our last afternoon and we were able to take buses or walk everywhere which was super convienent! The place was clean a short walk or bus ride downtown. And Crystal was so kind and easy to communicate with.

We've been fortunate to stay at Earlynn's wonderful place and our return visit was as ideal as the first.  As others have mentioned she is a generous hostess- thinks of every detail one might need- and in our instance when i left behind some earrings she went out of her way to drop the earrings off to our family who live nearby.  That same family is our lure for visits to Austin and finding a home away from home like Earlynn's that is so near to their home is a dream come true for us.  As someone wrote in an earlier review.  If you are looking for the perfect location and place to stay while you visit Austin.  Look no further.   Thanks so much Earlynn.

I stayed in this room for almost 2 months and it was very comfortable. The room came with a fridge microwave desk and its own bathroom. It was very easy to feel like home there. The location is one of the best things about this place since it took me 10 minutes to get to work (even in traffic. I worked on 6th and Congress). Andrea went above and beyond for her clients. She works very hard to make her clients happy and is very generous. When you do not have time to do laundry she does it for you. When you need something for your room she takes care of it right away. She buys special treats for guests from the market such as candies and watermelon. There would be a couple of days when I would come back from work and she offered me dinner. I highly recommend Andrea to anyone that is staying in Austin whether it is long or short term. Cereal oatmeal tea and coffee are available for breakfast. Free wifi no water/electric payments. Shopping areas are not too far of a drive either. Overall I had a great stay!,9/17/2013,1427814,Andrea,7363322,985862,Austin Zen Stay / New Classic 13,1,Natalie,54004144

This is great for the business traveler UT visitors couple exploring Austin or family of ~4 (day bed with trundle makes into effectively one king bed and the futon provides a full+ bed).  Excellent wifi.  Warm host who extends kitchen privileges. I will note that the room has three high windows on the North wall that will let some light enter in the mornings.

Jennifer's house was perfectly accommodating for our short stay in Austin.

She even left us a carafe of ice water by the bed. I have zero complaints.

Great location to stay in on 15mins to 6th st walking. I stayed with Angel for a week and can say she's a great lady with plenty of info for the newbie to Austin. Rooms are big enough so you have your own space if need be but the large living/kitchen area is cool. Plus the AC is great so even on the hottest of Austin days you've always got a chance to cool down. Really good laundry too and Angel has the bikes you can borrow if you need. If you're coming by car there's plenty of parking as well. I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone!,9/23/2013,880571,Angel,7503655,329306,Urban Homestead: Bikes + Chickens,1,Pete,54004271

Staying at Amy's Tiny House in Austin is like being a local. The house is tucked nicely away in such an ideal neighborhood to explore Austin. It is quiet yet close to all the bustle of South Congress Street. Amy keeps a very nice pad to relax and enjoy the city. The house is equipped with AC (nice for those hot Texas nights) toiletries kitchen items TV internet etc. Everything is thought of even spare razors toothpaste popcorn and local brew to taste (though I think previous Airbnb'ers may have left that we did the same!) :) The bed is very comfy and quite cozy up in the top loft. The backyard lounge environment is lovely and we were sad it rained and we didn't get much time to sit out and enjoy it for the weekend we were there. I would highly recommend this place for those staying for one night or seven. It is a great jump off point to see Austin and a wonderful place to lay your head. Amy is extremely communicative and was a pleasure to meet. Only other item - we had a 3 month old with us that was no problem with the loft environment but he is not rolling yet. It would be a bit nerve-wrecking if you have smaller active kids with the loft...,9/23/2013,5181843,Amy,7522659,954116,Tiny House- Best Central Location!,1,Emily,54004275

Really nice modern house.  The hot tub and sonos systems are a really nice touch.  We were here for a wedding and we fit about 8-10 guys per night.  Keep in mind if you don't want to bunk up people will have to sleep on air mattresses or the floor. (we left an extra one there enjoy)  The neighborhood is kind of bleh but easy to call a cab and a short trip to 6th street.  Please go to Franklin's while you are in Austin Terrance had a cooler we used to tailgate the line.  Terrance communicated the entire time and was very pleasant.

The Sun Room was quite lovely and the shower in the guest bathroom is luxurious. Valentina and Herb were wonderful hosts-- Valentina provided French press coffee fresh-squeezed orange juice and organic grapes every morning and Herb recommended some great places to eat which we really enjoyed. The location is fantastic. The only downside is that currently (as of our stay (phone number hidden)) there is construction going on next door which required earplugs so as not to be woken up at 7AM. They only did the construction on Friday & Saturday morning though so Sunday and Monday mornings were peaceful!

Where to start? I guess the word amazing pretty well sums it up. We could not have picked a better place to stay for the weekend. When we arrived the house was pristinely clean and just as beautiful as the pictures had indicated. Abianne made everything as easy as possible by making sure we knew the codes to everything and leaving her contact information if we had any questions. She even got local beer and breakfast taco fixings to make our stay that much  more enjoyable. The house itself is awesome. The bed I slept in was so comfortable that I never wanted to leave. The location was also perfect for everything we needed as it is close to awesome restaurants a 10 minute cab to downtown area and close enough to the highway to make getting anywhere in the city easy. Everyone in our group kept saying in throughout the weekend - we hit the jackpot with Abianne's place. It seriously was perfect for us and I couldn't be more happy with our stay!

We had a wonderful stay with Earlynn  in Austin in September 2014. To be honest we never  even had to talk on the phone because her text and email communication was so exact and on spot. Furthermore notes and instructions inside the unit made it clear exactly how we should optimize everything that was there. We had a car but I think you could've gotten around Austin from the unit perfectly fine on bicycle and bus. One note for those who are attractive to mosquitoes you may want to bring your bug spray.

The backyard is so tranquil and a perfect place to just rest and clear your mind. The private bedroom has its own mini fridge and coffee maker but she went above and beyond offering  to share coffee and snacks with her as well.

Really nice apartment. I booked the place for a month and was really impressed with the accommodations... very comfortable. In a very quiet little neighborhood and the neighbors were all very friendly and helpful to. Felt like I was at home while staying here.

I regret that I must give Matt (and Airbnb) a failing grade. Here’s the bright news: Matt is a nice guy his house is great a nice front porch swing and beautiful common areas. The location rocks easy access to running trails 6th Street and good food is literally just around the block (try Chili’s Café on S. First & Annie for the best salsa ever). Why the failing grade? (1) He lost the reservation. Although I had booked his place long in advance reconfirmed shortly after booking and then reconfirmed again about a week before arriving Matt called me 5 minutes before I arrived on foot to tell me that my room was being rented by someone else. (2) His offer to have me sleep in an under-construction bathroom was uncool. When Matt advised about the error I thought for certain that we could find a way to make this work. His first suggestion was offering me an alternative room - what he called the “attic” (photo available on request). It was an unfinished bathroom tucked into the eaves of the house: no flooring no door no finished walls no lighting no anything. The attic will be great when finished but suggesting that tossing down a mattress on the floor beside the toilet was asking for too much flex from a guest. (3) The end resolution unsatisfactory. I ended up staying with a friend for that night because I was skittish about Matt’s second offer to stay at a different house on the opposite side of town. Making sure that I wasn’t charged for the night was too much effort (Airbnb was zero help on this point). (4) I missed the insider insights that usually come from staying local. In other Airbnb-places the host has an insider guide gives a tour of the property explains what is available at the house and elsewhere and just imparts that local knowledge that makes the whole experience cool. Those things were missing here. Even after I got the room I booked (on the second night) the check-in was later than promised there were weird negotiations taking place (such as maybe I didn’t need all the bedding for the room?). If you book here (and I’m not suggesting not to Matt is a genuinely nice guy and his house is great especially for ACL or SXSW) take precautions. Confirm the booking by phone be specific about the time you are arriving and call him to make sure he will be there be proactive at all times if something is amiss and don’t expect Airbnb to assist. Austin is a fun city and having to worry about whether you have a place to sleep is not how I envisioned using my short time there. Even though this is not a positive review I might try Matt’s place again in the future the next time I’m back in Austin. We all make mistakes – I just can’t pretend that my Airbnb stay was something it...,10/1/2013,1348968,SoCoBnB /Matt,7739888,368156,Private Room B With Bath on SOCO,1,Stephen,54004416

We even didnt take a car at all because all the attractions of downtown and Zilker park were 30-40 minutes of pleasant WALK!

Thirdly - Brian is a super host we didnt meet him even didnt call or write a phone text message but every communication was more than easy - if we had a question - he just answered us on Airbnb like the same minute.

What a wonderful place to stay! It was perfect for three people. Clean comfortable bright and cheery are the first words that come to mind to describe this place that truly felt like our home for the weekend. The space is thoughtfully designed and so much fun to live in. Dolina is kind and sweet just present enough to make you feel comfortable (thanks for the coffee and milk!) but totally respects the privacy of her guests.

Christine was an incredible host! Commute to and from the condo was extremely easy due to the location near downtown and the Capital Metro train. We felt very safe and had plenty of space to park our cars. The condo itself was clean lovely and quite cozy! Christine was kind enough to leave us breakfast in the refrigerator coffee in the keurig and plenty of information about how to get around town.

A gorgeous home well appointed and spacious - we felt very comfortable there. For the architecturally inclined the neighbourhood is a great area to wander and check out a huge range of wonderful and eclectic homes. Ana was a pleasure to deal with and very responsive. The only reason I wasn't able to give it 5 stars is the proximity to the railway. The trains are quite active including throughout the night. This isn't a show stopper but if you are a light sleeper you should be aware of it. Otherwise a great find and perfect in every other way.

This condo is perfect for a medium to large group looking to experience the hip Austin restaurant/bar scene. We had a group of 7 guys visiting from all over the country and the place could've accommodated several more.  Awesome location you can walk to loads of cool bars restaurants and food trucks. The roof deck is a highlight. And Kristen and her husband are great hosts.

Jaime and Matt were great hosts!  Wife and I stayed for ACLFest and their place worked out great for us as it was about a 30 min. walk down to Zilker.  Their studio guest house was clean the futon couch was comfortable for sleeping and the outside sitting area was great to just relax outside for a bit.  They thoughtfully left both water and iced coffee for us in the fridge as well as some snacks that came in handy!  There place is also within walking distance to some great restaurants on Lamar and a coffee bar that made the best lattes (and a bakery next to it!).  Had some issues with wifi connection but wasn't a big deal as we spent most of our time on the go.  All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend their place for an Austin stay!,10/7/2013,424128,Jaime,7904556,78898,South Austin studio guest house,1,Larry,54004538
Kim was a responsible caring friendly host.  We just stayed the weekend for ACL and were really happy with the accommodations.  As other reviewers state the house is clean quiet and is close to SoCo and Barton Springs.  There is a lovely creek and park behind her house too!

"""This was my first experience using airbnb and because of Team Cinnaman it won't be my last.  Our stay at Cinnaman Villa was nothing short of perfect.

The beds were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on.  Vivienne was extremely accessible from the moment I reached out to her to inquire about staying here.

This is a perfect little gem of a place if you're a musician looking for a place to write in Austin and Aimee's record collection was exceptional. If you're afraid of heights or just a big unit then the mezzanine bedroom might be a bit much for you.

We also appreciated that she has a full kitchen as we had anticipated cooking some meals on our trip. However she did not have a microwave so we were unable quickly reheat any leftovers we had.

Jamie and Aja's gorgeous duplex has recently been renovated and is very clean and well-kept.  Jamie was accessible and easy to coordinate with.

They even offered to do our laundry had we needed it.  The new bath and shower work better than the ones in my apartment.  Many locations say that they are """"walkable/bikable"""" and centrally located but this one really is.  Whether you are coming for a music festival show or for a work function downtown there are sidewalks on several residential streets just north of Cesar Chavez that you can take all the way downtown if you choose to walk or take the bike in the duplex (lock and light provided).  We also took the 17 Capital Metro bus to the convention center one morning and to get to the bars on 6th Street. The 17 connects to bus routes that will take you to South Congress and a number of other districts.  There are dining/drinking options for everyone in the neighborhood.

From the moment we landed in Austin Tracy welcomed us py offering us a ride from the airport. But we wanted to take the easily accessible bus lines in to see the sites along the way. We arrived at Tracy's lovely property mid-day and as we climbed the one short flight of stairs and opened the door to the sweet one bedroom apartment we felt at home and knew we had picked the right location for a relaxing enjoyable stay. It was clean and you can cook with the fully equipped kitchen or easily walk to Wheatfield market to pick up some food or eat in any of the many local eateries yum. The buses are only a couple blocks away and Central Market where we picked up prepared delicious dinners was an easy way to end our days exploring. We often walked the hyde park neighborhood through to UT and on to the Capital building grounds. It's a beautiful area Tracy and Brian are gracious lovely hosts and you will have a wonderful time if you stay there.  I had initially  intended to travel alone and was in the process of booking the zen studio for one until my husband decided to join me so I booked the one bedroom.

Michele's place (very comfortable and located in a beautiful quaint and quirky neighborhood!) is walking distance to the bus stop and a light rail stop and you definitely need either a car or public transit to get downtown.

Not fancy but totally functional. The house had everything we needed and was in a nice neighborhood--a little off the beaten path but walking distance to SoCo if you're not in a hurry. One complaint: the beds are hard. I'm a firm mattress person but those were some tough beds. And a word of advice: if you're in town on a busy weekend (we were there for ACL) make your own transportation plans because the bus is sporadic late at night (or they had all been commissioned as ACL shuttles--we only saw one in SoCo over the course of a few late-night hours) taxis are impossible to get and pedicab drivers will generally not go that far from downtown (or they'll charge $100/cab).

Everything was just as described and the hosts couldn't be nicer. Excellent coffee maker (!!!) comfy bed and adorable/friendly cat. My hosts were helpful and even loaned me a pair of sandals when my clogs gave me blisters. These are people that know how to make you feel at home and at ease. I was offered several things that helped me out during my stay- I even washed some of my clothes which got rain soaked and muddy. Donna went out of her way to give me a tour of downtown as she took me to the airport. That was a very nice bonus! Beautiful neighborhood safe and peaceful.

My sister and I had an incredible time in Austin staying at Jill's lovely place. Jill and her kids were extremely accommodating and ensured we were well taken care of. We were in town for the Austin City Limits festival and loved every minute of it despite the unfortunate weather conditions. Jill was even able to drop us off at the festival on one of the days. My sister and I are huge foodies and Jill's recommendations did not disappoint (Torchy's Tacos Magnolia Cafe Bouldin Creek Cafe)! Where do I even begin on Jill's place...it was the perfect place for a getaway. I fell in love with the screen porch and definitely want one in my future home. I also loved the outdoor shower it was such a liberating experience! Her place had everything we needed: beds fresh linens towels kitchen bathroom shower refrigerator and WiFi. She even graciously provided some food and drinks and in the fridge! Another plus was her home's location; it was walking distance to SoCo and SoFi. Downtown also wasn't far away which made for a nice stroll. I highly recommend Jill's place!! This was an experience I will never forget...from staying on the screen porch to taking the pedicabs dancing at the festival in relentless rain scouring the city for pop up shows when ACL was canceled on Sunday and delicious food of course! Thanks so much Jill Larisa and Sergey for hosting us! I hope to be back soon =) -Rianne,10/15/2013,245318,Jill,8080239,52874,Charming Studio South AustinTx.,1,Rianne,54004797

I stayed at the Peaceful Place for ACL 2nd weekend and in spite of the rain thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Directions were clear and concise and Earlynn was absolutely wonderful and patient. Although I originally booked the place for a month I needed to make a couple of changes and she was quick to respond to my queries. The place itself is fantastic too - very close to where you want to be. The wifi connection was recently upgraded and all the amenities you need. Do you really need 500 tv  stations? Not if you plan on actually going out and doing things in one if the greatest US cities! I recommend staying at the peaceful place even just 1 night if not 20 or 30.

We took the bus to get around town which was right at the corner and followed its schedule pretty closely.  The Crow Bar on the corner was great to stop for a nightcap on your way home and the close-by SoCo neighborhood was fun to walk around and browse.

If you want a nice and comfortable place to stay in Austin look no further than CinnaMan Villa!  Viviane and Mike are awesome and you will love staying at their place when you and your small group travel to Austin. There were four people in our party two couples.  Each of us had our own bathroom and very comfortable bed (my wife and I slept on a king-sized memory foam mattress). And when we come to Austin next year I would have no hesitation staying there with two other couples. The upstairs is all yours - 3 separate bedrooms and two bathrooms with showers. Viviane was great from the moment I contacted her to the time we left and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to everything Austin.  We enjoyed talking to her over coffee (by the way-great coffee OJ and homemade breakfast pastries!) about Austin's food and culture. Getting around is pretty easy too - cabs are pretty easy to get (must get the 'Hailacab Austin' App) and the buses are a five minute walk (Austin Transit Times App will get you from where you are standing to where you need to be via bus).  CinnaMan the perfect place to stay for an Austin newbie like we were.

This house is situated right outside of the city so driving anywhere was super easy and only took me minutes to get downtown.

Andrew and Justin were very welcoming and the room was ok luckily it turned out my girlfriend couldnt make it because the bed is just very squeaky even just with one person!. Andrew seems a little upset about me complaining about the noise of the aircon 4 in the morning with it right on the wall next to the bed and the house is freezing is just not cool excuse the pun...I turned it down the first night after that i complained. Water on the bathroom floor sorry man swamp seems a little....dramatic. if i was autonomous it was because i came to Austin to meet people and have a good time i gave you a 280 dollar ticket to the festival as you had no money to buy it if you were that into meeting me you would have called to meet me for a beer at the event!

I surprised my husband for his 60th birthday by taking him to a city we've never been to but always wondered about - AUSTIN.  We loved it!  My best decision was staying at Kristen's AirBnB. CLEAN bright and comfy with free parking.  There was a lovely bottle of wine on the counter when we arrived which we thought was a sweet and welcoming touch. Kristen even gave us a list of things to do based on our interests. It was perfect!  The only thing that I'd mention is that the bed is a full size and was a little small for the two of us so we took turns on the sofa which was comfy but I guess we'd have preferred a queen size.

Jen's cabin was the perfect spot for a short 4 Day reprieve in Austin. I got to know the bus schedule/route pretty well so I was able to get around town self-directed. Jen was not around most of the time however neither was I. Jen has a code accessed door to her house to use the bathroom although the door had a few issues due to heavy rains. The only issue that I see for some guests is living amicably with Dmitry Jen's dog. He's a big boy and can get in your way since he hangs out on the front porch of the cabin most of the day and because it was rainy all weekend the porch got extremely muddy... Despite that it was a nice stay and if/when Jen makes an appearance I imagine she would be very hospitable.,10/17/2013,1907305,Jen,8133294,658102,Tiny House Privacy near Downtown,1,Jonny,54004878

"""The cabin is well outside the tourist/hotel ghettos that travellers often get stuck in so you get a much better sense of what Austin is REALLY like though Austin doesn't put up much of a façade to begin with. It is a bit out of the core but having a bike made it easy to get around quickly. The ride into downtown is easy with well marked bike lanes. Transit into the core is also fast and cheap ($1 or $2 for an all-day pass) and buses come very often down Guadalupe. Most buses have bike-racks too so you can bike into down and get a lift home if you get tired from exploring! Many would be tempted to just head straight into the core but definitely take a moment to explore Guadalupe (the north/south artery into downtown).

This is a great apartment close to downtown and UT. The unit itself is very clean and simple with all the space and amenities that I needed for my 3 day stay.

I stayed for 3 days 2 nights in this spacious yet cozy apartment with a good friend of mine.  We felt very comfortable being able to spend as much or as little time as we wanted in the apartment.  We cooked some meals in and the conditions for prepping & cooking food were great.  The cleanliness of the apartment is worth bragging about- everything had its place and was simultaneously very welcoming and comfortable.  We had plenty of space in the bedroom for our luggage and for just relaxing after a long day of exploring the city.  It actually felt like it was our apartment for the weekend which is a great feeling considering we were living out of our suitcases.  The flexibility with checking in and out was extremely helpful as we had no agenda for the weekend and our plans changed slightly from what we had originally anticipated.  It was very easy to communicate with Thien-y throughout the visit to know what the expectations were of us as visitors.  The gated community was a nice perk as we were visiting from out of town and felt very safe.  The accessibility to downtown was very convenient- we walked everywhere and took cabs if our shoes weren't walking-worthy.  Overall it was the ideal stay and I will definitely book with Thien-y again the next time I visit Austin!,10/21/2013,247128,Thien-Y,8215243,481518,1 private BR in SoCo 5min from DT,1,Sarah,54004926

Stayed here with two of my girlfriends during their visit to Austin. We had such a great time in this little house. It's perfect for 3 people (can accommodate 4 but I think it would have felt a little cramped with one more person). My friends stayed in the bedroom I stayed on the daybed in the living room and we all slept like babies. The little kitchenette is perfect for coffee and preparing light snacks (we made a buffet of wine and cheese and it was awesome) - but there are no cooking appliances so don't expect to prepare any stovetop meals. For what we needed this was perfect. The house is located on a busy thoroughfare so very easy to catch a cab. It's also very close to S Lamar's best restaurants and bars so we pretty much walked everywhere. Also only 20-30 min walk to Whole Foods downtown. Central Air was in perfect working condition so we could keep it cool during the day and heat it at night. And the Turnkey staff was very helpful when we needed assistance with the wifi password.

This condo was PERFECT!  I lived in ATX for 12 years and wanted to be near my old neighborhood.  This location was great and made it easy to get around.  The condo was clean nicely decorated and had everything that we could possibly need.  My mom has some mobility limitations and this condo is on the second floor but it's well-lit and she had no problems with the few stairs to get up to the front door.  Heather was also a gracious host and has put together a fantastic book with tips and info about Austin if you're unfamiliar.  Thanks for sharing your fabulous condo Heather!

This apartment met some of our expectations and not others.  I think this place would work better for people planning on late nights & looking to take advantage of its proximity to the bars & music venues.  We were in Austin to eat and explore after a long busy weekend working.  We wanted an apartment where we could relax and were not there for the late-night scene (one of us was pregnant).  As advertised the location in East Austin was great.  It's in walking distance to downtown 6th street and really close to some fun food trucks stores bars and restaurants.  It was also really easy to get everywhere from there by car.  Inside the apartment was decorated cute the linens were clean and Andi was responsive to any emails.  But it was in an older building so the property was somewhat rundown.  We slept rather poorly.  The walls were thin and the truck motorcycle and bus traffic on 6th street was loud all day and sporadically during the night.  Both mattresses were saggy but the smaller bed was creaky & less comfortable than the one in the blue room.  The smaller bedroom was also louder since it was on a corner with 4 windows.  The apartment is also over top of a restaurant/bar.,10/24/2013,11349,Alexandria,8301145,296286,Charming Apartment-BEST LOCATION! A,1,Megan,54005022

My wife baby and I stayed here for 5 nights. It is a very comfortable homey bungalow in an ideal location for access to downtown and central Austin. We loved the full kitchen comfortable beds Roku and quiet street within walking distance to a few coffee shops. A few mornings I went out running around the golf course situated no more than 100 feet from the front door. Ananda and Dunstan were incredibly responsive helpful and generous. Case in point: After the internet had gone out one evening leaving us without streaming Netflix (which we depend on after the baby goes to sleep) Ananda brought us a gift card to a local bakery up the street to say sorry for the snafu.

The guest house was really lovely! It was a little on the older side but heavy on the charm and more importantly as a New Yorker who prefers to avoid having a car when possible the location was great to make it around to lots of great places by walking without a car. It was about 5-10 minutes to plenty of great places on South Congress and another 20-30 to get to 4th St and 6th St for a second round.

Vicky was so good about checking in with us to see if everything was ok and if we had any questions she responded immediately. The weather was perfect so it was really nice sitting in the backyard or on the front porch bench. Best of all the location was perfect. Short walk to Soco and First streets with all the popular shops and eateries. Even my 92 year old mother enjoyed the ease of walking to nearby locations.

The positive reviews of the Zilker Suite are misleading. Cleanliness of the unit is average at best. The TV in the (adjacent) main house is right next to the head of the murphy bed in the suite so you can literally hear every word through the wall. On our stay the TV didn't turn off until midnight. I also had to kill a cockroach at least 3 inches long in the bathroom. Between the roach and the TV I was so frustrated I told Daniel we needed to leave. He did refund our 2nd night's stay but also specifically asked that we not review him on this site which I believe is a disservice to anyone looking for a comfortable clean quiet place to stay in Austin.

Flat screen in the bedroom as well. They have 2 cats but we barely saw them.  They are such a fun couple and the only disappointment is that we didn't get to hang out with them more!

Joe and Bella's lovely little gem of a home is our favorite place to stay in Austin.

A fully-stocked kitchen with spotless amenities such as a refrigerator microwave and coffee maker extra linens (which smell heavenly) a hair dryer a flat-screen TV and beautifully decorated surroundings make us feel at home and well-cared for.

Eric is a friendly generous and considerate host.  He was clear and concise in our communications about our stay and he responded quickly to our requests (where to eat breakfast and access to wine glasses).  His rental space is new clean neat efficient and cleverly divided into 2 separate yet connected spaces.  We are big fans of minimalist aesthetic and so this place suited us to a T.  It would be perfect for 2 friendly couples 4 singles or a family of 4.  Eric was also appreciative of our feedback to add a shelf in the bathroom.  We also loved the location!  Perfectly convenient to everything we wanted to do (eat good food see interesting neighborhoods explore cool shops walk at town lake).  If we hadn't had our baby with us we'd have enjoyed taking advantage if Eric's generous offer to use his 2 bikes.  All in all - we'd definitely stay here again!  a note to patents with small kids: the concrete floors in this space made for easy cleanup (we've got a spitter-upper!) but also made us anxious about falls (our little guy is just learning to sit up) - not a deal-breaker but if you bring little ones consider bringing an activity mat of some sort.,10/28/2013,8716539,Eric & Erin,8394916,1641751,Bicycle bnb in South Central Austin,1,Deanna,54005138

There's a guest binder filled with everything from wifi connection directions to restaurant menus to maps on how to walk to Barton Springs pool and Zilker Park.

The house was better than we expected from the photos online!  Michelle and her dogs were very friendly the house was comfortable and inviting and it was the perfect space for entertaining a small group of friends.  Another guest posted that this was the perfect fit between a hotel with high quality finishes and feeling like being at home... and I couldn't agree more.  The upstairs bed is so comfortable and the memorabilia throughout the house is interesting and fun.  A huge plus was that it took us about 10 minutes to get to the airport downtown and basically everything else we were doing while in town!

We were in Austin for the Austin Film Festival and the location of the condo was awesome!  We were just a couple of blocks from most of the AFF theaters and conference venues and all the dining/nightlife Austin is famous for.  Since we didn't have a car during our visit we really appreciated that the CapitalMetro bus to/from the airport ($1 per person each way!) stopped within about a block of the condo.  The main drawback was that it was pretty noisy-- lots of downtown construction revelers and the building itself isn't well sound insulated so it was very easy to hear neighbors in their condos upstairs courtyard conversations all the passersby on the sidewalk and of course traffic.  It is a ground floor condo (window blinds mostly stayed shut) but we felt safe given that the complex has access gates as well.  The condo was nice and clean and the kitchen was appointed for more minimal food preparation.  That turned out to be just fine for us because we ended up indulging in many of the nearby restaurants for our main meal of the day and just doing breakfast/lunch there.  There isn't an actual grocery store nearby but at one point we made the trek on foot to Whole Foods for supplies (about a 25-minute walk each way).  We had some trouble with the internet connection and with getting the dishwasher to work (we had no idea there'd be a wall switch to control the dishwasher's power!) but Erica and her team were available and responsive when we called for assistance.  I think if we were to come back again we'd not hesitate to stay in this condo or another of Erica's.,10/31/2013,4641823,Erica,8443771,1529416,2BR/2BA Incredible Downtown Condo,1,Tamar,54005222

She also had a first aid kit sunscreen insect repellant and even bags to bring to the farmer's market; really you name it and it was there. The place was extremely clean and well kept and Alexis checked in regularly to make sure we were comfortable and to give us the update on things like parking changes to let us know to move our car. She really runs this like a business which we really appreciated. The location is within walking distance of nearly everything.

We stayed for a month and had a wonderful time. This was a bit of a unique situation as we actually rented the apartment from the previous owner and stayed in it under Andrews ownership. The place itself is absolutely impeccable. Spotless and very well located. Andrew was easy to communicate with via text messaging (as he lives out of town) but there was an on site property manager who offered his hand and help the very day we arrived. You get exactly what's pictured and the descriptions are quite accurate. The bed was magnificent. So comfortable with lovely bedding. Most everything we needed in the way of basics (linens bathroom necessities etc) and appliances were available to us and of very good quality. The neighborhood is very quite safe and somewhat walkable by Austin standards. You can hear a train periodically but I do quite like that and for those that don't earplugs were provided. I'd recommend this place for young couples and people in town for partying.

Susan and her family were the most hospitable hosts I have ever dealt with. The apartment was very clean in a wonderful neighborhood 5 minutes from everything in Austin. The room had all the amenities of a hotel but with way better service. Susan and her husband Anthony were always quick to offer help or advice and were very attentive and yet completely unobtrusive. The apartment had a separate entrance so I never felt like I was bothering them coming or leaving. Bathroom was gorgeous and the Japanese style tub was very relaxing. This was my first airbnb experience and I cannot express how pleased I was. At one point in the trip we had left one of the lights on in our vehicle and Susan and her husband noticed and sent me a text to check it out preventing us from having a dead battery in the morning.

My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend to attend a charity event in Austin.  The place was great! I was a little hesitant at first because it was the first time we used airbnb but we had such a great time! I would recommend having a car as most things were pretty far away and we ended up spending a lot of money on cabs but everything about the bungalow was perfect. The buses were really easy to navigate (and take cash! a wonderful practice that I am not used to in NYC) and the restaurants within walking distance of the bungalow were really delicious (i.e. Habana and Opal Divine).

The cottage had everything we needed and more for 2 evenings in Austin...a comfortable bed kitchen area - complete with a delicious yogurt selection juice wine coffee etc. - and a cute bathroom area with excellent water pressure. The cottage was quiet and surprisingly secluded in his backyard and had a ton of natural sunlight (don't worry there were plenty of blinds). Not only did the cottage rock but so did Steve! He gave us great dining recommendations in the neighborhood and directions to the closest laundromat. All in all phenomenal place to stay! Great location too.

The accommodations were clean well appointed and just perfect for what we needed while there.  The patio was a delight and the four daschunds I met there were most charming.  Dan is a very friendly host whose aim is to make sure his clients are happy and comfortable in their surroundings.  It is so much nicer than a hotel or motel.

On that note I should mention that I found this place to be highly accessible for non-car folks like myself (I went to a concert that ended quite late in the evening and was still able to easily catch the bus home) and the bus fare is incredibly reasonable in Austin which helped me trim my travel budget.,11/8/2013,5152543,Marcella,8616340,949922,Vintage Airstream in East Austin T,1,Johanna,54005406

We recently stayed in Sarah's cottage and while there are some very nice things about it sadly our experience wasn't as overwhelmingly positive as everyone else's. Positives: the cottage is cute and nicely decorated with a really nice bathroom (great shower!) and a comfortable bed. It's also quiet well located and with easy access to the rest of Austin and beyond. Negatives: the WIFI is almost non existent. When we did manage to connect the signal was so weak it took a long time to load just a single page. As international travellers who can't use data while roaming and rely on free WIFI this was very frustrating especially as the property is advertised as having internet. The cottage could also do with some dusting / cleaning. It wasn't too bad (the main things i.e. bathroom / bed were clean) but things like the fridge shelves floor etc. needed some attention. And finally we also found the host unresponsive and not particularly helpful. This again seems different to other people's experiences and perhaps there is a reason but it was definitely disappointing. A message I sent before arrival was never answered. When we arrived there was an email from Sarah but it was just to tell us to check out at 11 or if we could check out earlier to let her know. I replied to this with our check out time and also asked if we could borrow two wine glasses - again no response. I sent her another email the next day. This time she replied saying that she'll lay out two glasses for us - but they never appeared! As she was at home throughout our entire stay (although we never met) I'm not sure why it was that difficult to put two glasses into our room. I know this wasn't a hotel or a professional B&B but I wasn't expecting to be ignored (which is never a nice feeling!). So all in all unfortunately we will be looking to stay somewhere else next time we're in Austin.,11/9/2013,359112,Sara,8621192,70659,Private Cottage-Near UT/Hyde Park,1,Belma,54005410

For starters the decor is incredible the place could be in a magazine. It's mid century modern meets Texas and the light is gorgeous I had a hard time tearing myself away to leave for the day! The pictures on this site are good but it's even better and feels bigger in person (very roomy for someone coming from NYC). Second the location is really really great. I had stayed on South Congress during a previous visit but Gretchen's location is better. I loved being able to walk to South Lamar South First AND South Congress. I felt like I saw much more of Austin than I had previously. In fact I did the whole thing on foot without renting a car. When I wanted to go further afield the bus system was a snap and one of the major ones stops 30 seconds from her place. I am a serious walker and I did also walk to the bars and coffee shops in East Austin as well as to the Broken Spoke.

I only stayed at the Bicycle BnB for two nights with a girlfriend but it was perfect for us! It was really easy to check in and when Eric arrived home from work he helped me with the bikes and told me to let him know if there was anything I needed. This space is definitely big enough for up to 6 people even though there's only one bathroom. Plenty of clothing storage space and lots of natural lighting which I really like. The only thing I would recommend to Eric is to get some sort of heating fan for the winter months. I was cozy enough at night with blankets but since the floors are concrete I would suggest for the winter having some sort of warming unit in the place. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and Eric was very helpful. The waters in the fridge were a definite plus since I don't trust tap water anywhere except Manhattan.

Ruth was incredibly considerate too -- we were traveling with our one-year old and she put childproof locks on all the kitchen cabinets it made for a really child-friendly and anxiety-free time in the house since we could have our one-year old roam freely.",11/10/2013,,,8638425,962639,,1,Mark,54005435

Our stay (4 guests) with Josh & Adam was quite a bit of fun. Their house is comfy quiet and both Josh and Adam are both incredibly hospitable and sincere. We loved their awesome outgoing dogs their willingness to accommodate us at only 24 hours notice and their helpfulness in navigating Austin. The house is a bit far outside of the main city for walking into downtown so we had to order a taxi which was a pain (45 minute wait and a $15-20 fare) on a Saturday night but that's the price you pay if no one wants to be designated driver! :) We highly recommend a stay with Josh & Adam!,11/11/2013,2546033,Josh & Adam,8683319,607536,Mid-Century Modern in hip E Austin,1,Gabriel,54005444

Their home is located a very short drive (10 minutes) from downtown Austin and the University of Texas on a quiet residential street with plenty of parking. Our only word to the wise is that the lofted bedroom has big beautiful windows that look out over the backyard so that it feels like sleeping in a treehouse -- but those windows don't have curtains so you'll wake up with the sun.

I especially loved that Sara was available by text anytime I needed her but the trailer and backyard were all mine. The entire time I felt like I was at a private spa retreat only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Austin but able to just get away and chill at the trailer as much as I needed.

AMAZING!! We booked Mary's cottage based on the rave reviews of previous guests and it really didn't disappoint. Incredibly easy to locate great parking facilities and very easy access to the cottage with the door code. Welcomed by the local cat Jackson we quickly felt at home and at ease. The cottage was clean bright and had great decor and everything you could possibly need from towels to milk to insect bite cream. We walked everywhere from the local recommendations from Mary (which were better than any of the guide books we had) all the way into town and back. Walking was a fun discovery but local buses and taxis were very accessible too. The local supermarket was great all amenities you could possibly need within walking distance. The Boudin cafe for a vegetarian breakfast and awesome coffee and Freddies for lunch were particular highlights.

Kade's house was clean uncluttered and recently renovated. It was very easy to get comfortable. Kade was quickly responsive to all of our emails and questions with helpful suggestions on places to go. The best part of the house is the location next to E. 6th Ave and downtown - November in Austin was like June in Portland. We walked everywhere from the house to S. Congress  to U Texas to LBJ museum and the house was a great base. The neighborhood looks to be developing quickly with food cart pods art spaces hip small businesses and multi-use condos and we felt safe.

Gorgeous spot! My husband and I were in town for a Wedding and we were so lucky to have found Trudy's bungalow. The scenery is beautiful & the bungalow is amazing. The design & decor is awesome. I would love to have that bathroom in my home! We had privacy which was the best part. Trudy was available if we needed her but we were given space to enjoy our time away from home. Beats out my past hotel experiences by far!!! We never ran out of towels coffee or toilet paper. The best part is Trudy has a binder full of local resources right there for you to use.

Drew definitely is a Superhost! I asked him if the apartment had a guidebook a few days before my arrival and he ordered one for us to use. Check-in was easy. Even though we arrived later than our original plan Drew was very warm friendly and enthusiastic. Without us asking he gave us a tour of the apartment and his recommendations in the city since we've never been to Austin before. We loved Ginny's chicken sh!t bingo that he recommended as well as his tip for saving us 2-hours of waiting at Franklin's! True to the photos the apartment was clean (smelled very minty) with Dr. Bronner castile soap in the shower for your use. He provided us with a space heater which was useful since we were there during the cold spell. They no longer have chickens though so we didn't get any fresh eggs but there were plenty of good food options in Austin. We liked that Drew gave us our privacy and texted us to check-in on how our stay was going (even giving us driving tips for avoiding traffic). Our three-day stay was too short and I regret not having time to check out the Yelp link that he made on the surrounding Hyde Park area - we finally drove up Duval on our way to the airport and saw all the spots we could've walked to from the apartment!,11/13/2013,336916,Drew,8718147,68130,Hyde Park Flat - Bamboo Floors,1,Diana,54005592

My daughter Wendi and I stayed there booking the green and the pink rooms. She lives in CA and I live in MD so Austin was a great meeting point for a vacation.  Larry and Joanna did so much to make sure we had a wonderful experience.  Joanna drove me to the Greyhound station to pick up Wendi (arriving from Houston) because she thought the route there was confusing.   Larry was always ready with suggestions for our days and nights out perusing the newspaper for current performers.  Thanks Larry our evening of dancing and listening to music at the Continental Club was super.   I went to early morning yoga class twice with Joanna got to meet some of their friends and had full use of the kitchen which was great for storing/heating up leftovers from those delicious Austin restaurants/food trucks. Plus breakfast was included and we had the use of their two bicycles which we rode on the trails by Lady Bird Lake.

Beautiful home in a great location. Found it to be very convenient stocked with all the necessities and super cute.

Ana was a fantastic host! She was easy to contact and very welcoming. She knew all the local spots and was interesting to talk to. The house was just as advertised. Beautiful top floor and very cool porch with a view of the skyline. The south Austin neighborhood was super fun. If you want to do a lot of down-towning at night then you may want something closer to or in downtown because public transport in Austin is not good. Otherwise Ana's place was perfect for exploring the very hip and relaxing south Austin scene. I have no complaints about her or her fab sky house!,11/16/2013,5477881,Ana,8753432,1173760,South Austin Sky House,1,Adam,54005641

I had a wonderful experience during my first trip to Austin while staying in Lindsey's adorable cottage! This was my first experience using AirBnB and I cannot say enough good things about our stay- Lindsey was extremely easy to get in touch with and helpful leading up to our trip and made sure that my boyfriend and I were comfortable and happy. The cottage is located in a beautiful and convenient part of town--  quiet enough for sound sleep and walking distance from good restaurants/bars. We loved the decorations and little touches throughout the cottage. Since we only came into town for 3 days we didn't really utilize the kitchen but it is fully appointed for cooking a proper meal. Lindsey even offered us some fresh eggs from her chicken coop! I hope to come back to Austin and if so I would love to stay here again!,11/17/2013,7386854,Lindsey,8773061,1398635,The Crow cottage near UT & downtown,1,Alisa,54005645

Steve was really nice and made the experience very easy. The cottage is also very comfortable and feels quiet and secluded. It's about a $10-$12 cab ride to downtown so it's outside of downtown without being too far. I'd definitely stay again.,11/17/2013,5620519,Steve,8773783,1021139,Backyard Cottage in Central Austin,1,Dave,54005647
Amber's place is a great spot to stay while you're in Austin. Located right beside Barton Springs and a short cab ride up to 6th and Congress or South Congress you're really in a superb location to do a bunch of the things you need to while in town. This place is super clean and Amber is a fantastic host. This is an ideal spot with plenty of place for a single person or a couple. It was a bit tight for 2 guys to be sleeping here but we had a feeling from the pictures it was going to be that way. In any case we really enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend Amber's place to others.,11/17/2013,2595932,Amber,8772455,528338,Suite Spot (Zilker),1,Wayne,54005648

I couldn't have asked for a better getaway spot! We went down to Austin for one night on Saturday with the intention of going out to 6th street for the evening and once we arrived at Michael's place we saw what a little oasis it was and we didn't even go out. If you're in need of a quiet relaxing place to decompress and forget your troubles this is the place for you! The garage apartment is very clean and cozy with a great kitchen stocked with all the utensils you'd need to cook with (we got up Sunday morning bought breakfast food and made our own breakfast there instead of going out). I can't decide which feature about Michael's place is my favorite but If I had to choose it would be the enclosed outdoor shower (don't worry there's also a normal shower in the restroom inside). Michael Ann is the perfect host - very welcoming and she always responded in a timely manner to all of our questions. She is a wonderful person with a refreshing free spirited attitude and I'm so glad to have met her.,11/18/2013,2536590,Michael Ann,8810936,869081,Beautiful Backyard Garage Apartment,1,Maria,54005650

This house was awesome. Perfect location perfect size perfect hosts! The house is amazing from how it's decorated to the layout and size. Jessica met us on arrival and she is just a cool person. Everyone in our group decided that we not only wanted to be friends with her but bring her to each of our houses so that she can decorate them all. She is very welcoming and accommodating left little treats out for us which was very kind took us on a tour of their awesome pad recommended nearby places to visit and even let us use their bikes which they had five of. Her and her husband were obvious music lovers as there were speakers and iPod connections everywhere plus I recognized some Postal Service lyrics in a piece of their art work...sweet! Plus their record player and collection were the tops. The location of the house was perfect not close to the hustle and noise of the city but close enough to downtown and nearby shops and restaurants/food trucks. There was plenty of parking and finding it was a breeze. The patio and upstairs balcony were perfect too. You can see part of the city at night from the second story patio balcony and the downstairs patio have ceiling fans!

Staying at Genna's was the best decision of an overall delightful trip!  You are welcomed SO warmly into their home that you feel more like you are visiting old friends - if your old friends know how to make your stay comfortable and highly supported.  An amazing cook Genna's interior and glorious back yard is captivatingly decorated UBERclean and has a snug feel. You could spend hours just on the amazing book/vinyl record collection but the detailed suggestions of this expert on local goings on will have you zipping out to ideal Austin spots for tasty restaurants and local events that will make every hour of your trip simultaneously worthwhile and yet pleasantly relaxed.  Of course I was happy to return and hear the sound of classic music and smell the rich aroma of wine and gourmet cooking.  The perfect way to enjoy Austin is to have Genna's as a home base - I have already recommended to every friend who will listen.  I actually felt bad for everyone else who didn't know about this gem while in Austin.  Stay there! :),11/18/2013,9097021,Genna,8797417,1741976,Private Room & Bath 3 min to ACL!!,1,Gary,54005698
Rented this house for F1 weekend.  Was very pleased how the house looked on the inside wouldn't expect the comfort from the looks of the (website hidden) was very easy to get answers from with  any ?'s I had.  The only complaint we had was the bathtub in the hallway filled up with water when showering.  Wasnot a BIG deal cause we just used the other in master bedroom.  Overall was very pleased with the rental.  Hope to do business with again,11/18/2013,1282837,Joseph,8778222,603084,Modern Spacious 3/2/2 South Austin,1,Jeff,54005699
The house was wonderful - I felt as if I was living in an interior decorator's house.  It was also close to downtown Austin so that made all trips there short.  I would recommend this house to anyone.,11/18/2013,3965616,Catherine,8779823,753837,Two-story house in East Austin,1,Kim,54005700
I'm so glad I came across Suzanne's post on Airbnb. I felt like I was staying at a friends house for the weekend. My boyfriend came in from NJ he never tried the Airbnb experience so I was a little nervous.  He enjoyed it especially when Suzanne's boyfriend told him about the home game Longhorns v Sooners! I would definitely go back to Suzanne crib felt right at home and minutes away from downtown.,11/18/2013,1419239,Suzanne,8808419,378626,Airport F1 COTA SXSW ACL Downtown,1,Stefanie,54005701
Brian and Leah's cool quiet house was the perfect location for our Austin getaway. We often caught a bus wherever we were going and then enjoyed a cheap cab ride home. Alternately we could walk back from Congress & 6th in about 40 mins. The house was loaded with new appliances and comfortable furniture. We had some problems with the heat during our stay but Brian and Leah had it fixed as quickly as possible.

Ms. Sevylla was a courteous host during our stay. She didn't hesitate to answer any questions and the room was excellent. The bus route passes right in front of her house (pick up on the corner and drops off a door down if head to downtown). Be sure to pay attention to the night owl bus route because one route will end 2 miles before your drop off point. Just be sure to ask your driver if it goes by E Stassney! The bus ride to down town is about 20min during traffic hours but otherwise is fairly quick.

The guest house is in great shape clean everything is new and works directions were easy to follow. I was feeling a little sick while in Austin and she offered me some tea which I really appreciated (I had to say no since I don't drink tea). Also the blinds didn't arrive on time for my stay so she put a sheet which looked like the real deal to me and she even offered me a ride to the airport because of this. I will totally rent this guest house again if I ever go back to Austin. The neighborhood is very nice the lake is pretty close and there are not one but two vegan places you can walk to on Cesar Chavez. Great location! Jeany thanks for all your help and your good care.

I was in town with two other guys for the F1 weekend. I managed a decent arrangement last year and thought I would try it again with a slightly larger closer location. I found Eileen's listing and after some discussion we decided it was an acceptable place. It turned out to be a great match of location space privacy and convenience.

Very clean & comfortable. The only thing worth mentioning for those considering staying here--it wasn't very soundproof. We could hear the people downstairs talking playing music etc. They weren't doing so at odd hours or anything however. Also it's walkable to downtown but only if the conditions are right--i.e. not in November when it's freezing! :-),11/26/2013,9168485,Ginger,8934368,1741604,Cielo Room: 2nd story apartment,1,Jenny,54005971

This is the perfect house for an Austin visit! We felt tucked away in a cozy house with a yard and plenty of space to hang out with friends. And in about a 5 minute walk we were in the center of everything great on South Congress! It was unexpectedly cold for Austin and Krista was so sweet to drop off an extra blanket! It has everything you need including off street parking (renting a car in town was easy and cheap and there is an Enterprise walking distance away). We loved our stay!

Overall this is a great place to stay. I stayed for about a month. It is a nice location in Austin however it is right behind a dry cleaners. This is the only bad thing about the house. The dry cleaners has a very large exhaust fan which can shake the entire house at times. If you are a light sleeper this house is not for you. If not or if you don't mind ear plugs I would highly recommend it. My interaction w Elisa was quick and professional.

They provided a welcome packet that made our after midnight arrival smooth and very easy. They had left the heating on so the apartment was nice and cozy when we arrived. Even though everything was great they took the extra step of asking us if everything was ok after a day or two - a sign of an excellent host. There are plenty of local shops within walking distance and its a 5 mins drive to downtown.  Overall a very nice experience.

This was my first time to Austin and my first Airbnb experience and I have to say Mary has set the bar Very High!. This was a very special birthday trip for my mother and sister and me. We all flew in from around the country to be together to celebrate. I researched many places before deciding on this one. And I could not have been more pleased. Dealing with Mary was a pleasure she answered all questions promptly and was super helpful with my touristy ones. We just loved the cottage and the added hospitality. (There were drinks and snacks in the refrigerator- so appreciated by weary travelers! ). It's location proved to be perfect as we explored the city. We could walk to shops and restaurants and then it was a super easy taxi ride to other parts of the city.  We also enjoyed meals in and found the kitchen stocked with everything we needed.  If you are looking for a comfortable inviting setting then this little home away from home is the place for you!

We stayed the first half of Thanksgiving week at the Cain's accommodations while visiting family in Austin.  The guest house is cute warm and cozy.  Everything was clean and tidy and comfort items like linens comforters towels etc. were top-notch plentiful.  We loved the 'chicken' companions - they were friendly and entertaining.  The living space is bright with plenty of windows to let sunlight in when you want it; with blinds and curtains to draw closed when you want your privacy.  The bathroom and shower is a pretty tight space for anyone that's large or tall but it's livable.  We had no plans of cooking so the kitchenette (fridge microwave and coffee maker) fit our needs perfectly.  We will definitely look for availability here on future trips.  We were always pleased with the responsiveness and communication of the hosts.  M & P,11/28/2013,989596,John,8958717,202187,South Congress Studio Apartment,1,Mark,54005995

We had the misfortune to visit Austin during an unusually cold and rainy November. When we arrived at Tiny House though Amy had a fresh pot of coffee waiting for us. The house is definitely tiny but very well appointed. The kitchen is fully stocked for cooking and Amy had provided coffee milk bread and eggs. There were even a couple beers in the fridge. She has a combo AC/heat unit that was more important than we would have guessed! By cranking the heat and with a small space heater downstairs we were mostly warm enough. Under normal weather conditions I'm sure Tiny House would be very comfortable. As noted in the description the loft does have a low ceiling. Amy has a fantastic selection of games as well as a few books and magazines and some local maps and tour books that were helpful. The only thing I would recommend is that you bring your own music since there's no radio CD player or speakers for your phone/iPod/etc. The neighborhood is quiet (and beautiful!). We weren't able to take advantage of Amy's yard because of the weather but it was very inviting with chairs a fire pit and plenty of wood and plenty of space for lounging. There was even a hula hoop!  We highly recommend renting from Amy who was very communicative.

I highly recommend staying with Danielle!  I had an incredible time!  I spontaneously decided to ride the Megabus to Austin and stayed with Danielle.  There was a bus stop a block from her place which was extremely convenient since I didn't drive.  I hiked Lady Bird Lake and Greenbelt (awesome!).  I love Mozarts coffee too - right on the lake. I think Flipnotics had great coffee and was pretty cool too.  Went to a tailgate party and checked out the infamous tacos at Juan in a Million.  Danielle was a great host and her place is sooo cute!  I enjoyed reading on her deck playing the guitar and slept great.  I had access to the kitchen and anything I needed.  There's a corner store a few blocks away that has great breakfast tacos wine etc.  I can't think of any negatives.  I truly enjoyed the entire experience and would definitely stay with her again.

The Treetop Guest House is luxurious. The beds are super comfortable the decor is lovely and it is spacious. When we wanted to do things together there were these great sitting areas upstairs and downstairs as well as on the upper deck....felt like we were sitting up in the trees with the birds. Then when we were needing space it is designed to feel like two separate apartments one upstairs and one downstairs. It is great to have that luxury...and having the mini kitchens both upstairs and downstairs gave us a chance to have coffee on our own in the morning. I really appreciated that. The entire place is light and feels clean no clutter...just (website hidden) upstairs and downstairs was nice and super easy way that they did private entry code and wifi code. The place was full of little gifts...both mini fridges had nice surprises candy on the bed tables and the toiletry items were so nice that we went on amazon and ordered some for ourselves before we left.  The neighborhood is beautiful super close to all that we wanted to do at zilker park and downtown...everything minutes away. We even got good movie tips from Susan and Diane. Next time we come we plan to reserve tennis courts at the South Austin tennis club that is so close it makes sense to walk rather than drive. The house was so pretty the pictures just couldn't capture it on the website.... and the pictures were the reason we picked it.

The space was great - clean and cutely decorated. Jamie was also very prompt in responding to emails. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is about the proximity of the apartment to Interstate 35 and the noise associated with that (it's like a constant hum). If you are noise sensitive/a light sleeper this may not be the place for you.

Great hostess most accommodating for all of our needs.  Location was perfect for everything we needed to do. Few issues though: no way to make a simple cup of coffee - there was a press and beans that we did not know how to use and when we opted for tea could not find a clean pot to use to boil water. We went out every morning to get takeout coffee for the group.Second issue was with airbnb - seemed like the preferred communication method was Facebook and we do not have an account. And lastly we came with five people and there was not appropriate bedding for all. One son got to sleep on the floor on an airmattress and the other had to make do with a non-pullout couch (most uncomfortable).,12/4/2013,7164229,Abbey,9069050,1419863,Bungalow on the East Side!,1,Rocco,54006125

Nora was an incredible communicator: prompt super-friendly and willing to accommodate our needs. She had a quart of  our favorite milk waiting for us in the fridge! The apartment was very clean and there were extra blankets linens and towels plus everything we needed to keep house for a weekend. We were a group of 9 with people staying in 4 different places all arriving to the airport at different times. Coordinating details was a challenge when Olivia's grad ceremony ended an hour early and Nora saved the day by calling to check on how we were doing. I appreciated this so much. We were able to work out getting the key and Nora was so kind when I had to call her at about 10 pm to ask a question!!!  The living space was open and roomy enough for all 9 of us to congregate there Sunday afternoon cook eat play charades and watch a football game. The TV is a really nice one.  It was too cold to use the patio but we would have had it been nice outside.  I recommend Nora's apartment wholeheartedly.  Nora is dependable willing to accommodate needs and a sweetheart.

Since Austin had its coldest weather in a decade during my stay it was great to be in a warm cozy place.

The apartment is super cozy and homey. I stayed there for 11 days (on my own) and was perfectly comfortable. The fact that they have a full fridge dishes etc. was really great for a longer term stay. The place is about a mile or so from the """"hub"""" of south congress (bars and restaurants) and another mile from downtown.  Therefore I'd recommend a rental car.

The Hideaway was everything it was pictured to be and more. We immediately felt like we were at home - but better cleaner more organized and more comfy than home! The design and decor was just exquisite in every way - we now need to find out the make of the bedding because after we arrived home we realized our bed is nowhere near as comfortable! The location is perfect - so close to South Congress you can walk but on a quiet street so you can escape and feel like you're on a retreat. We loved our stay and were actually thrilled to have the opportunity to stay an extra night when our flight home was delayed due to NYC snowstorms! I will recommend this place to everyone I know who is planning a trip to Austin - to stay anywhere else would be foolish.

The only two problems I had were the weak wifi signal (not a problem if you are a US citizen as you can depend on 3/4G) and the house doorknob.

I landed in Austin at Sharon's for my first week of an extended retreat of sorts and felt very welcomed by Sharon. She is a great host and I found her personable easy going intelligent and generous. She upgraded my room when I got there and I had the place to myself much of the time I was there. I loved the setting of the house…treed backyard with chickens (and fresh eggs) looking out over predominately treed hills and I had many a sit in the chair out in the front yard under the trees with the sun filtering through. Really nice area to walk in and close to Zilker Park Barton Springs and the Botanical Gardens. I found the house to be fairly comfortable although it needs repair work and deeper cleaning IMO.

Both this property and its owner Jason were amazing! The condo was beautifully furnished perfectly clean and stocked with everything we needed from a Keurig coffee maker to hair conditioner! Additionally it had an AMAZING VIEW of downtown!!! Jason was available by call or text for any problems that we could have encountered. Jason also accommodated several personal requests. My fiancé and I had just gotten engaged and Jason provided a bottle of champagne. He also personally reviewed a list of things to do in Austin that we sent him ahead of time and provided suggestions. He even let us use his personal printer when we needed to print off something unexpectedly. Finally we accidentally left our coats in the condo. We contacted Jason right away and he happily agreed to mail us our coats! This was an amazing place to stay close to downtown.

"""I stayed in Brian & Leah's house during the week of Christmas with my family and we had a great stay. The house is well equipped and in a good location (probably a ~15 minute walk to get into the main part of SoCo). The rooms were good size and very comfortable. The kitchen is nice and has most of the basic cooking tools you would need for simple meals. We were cooking Christmas dinner so a baking pan and larger skillet would have helped but we made do without them. Also we weren't sure if we could use the long horn grill for actual grilling or not. We decided against it as it looked more like a sculpture than a functioning grill so that was a bummer (but we might have been overly cautious)!",12/30/2013,,,9466035,1599035,,1,John-Henry,54006456

We are a famliy of 4 and we stayed with Andrea for more than 10 days.The room bathroom kitchen and the entire place is very tidy  clean and comfortable. We loved the food cooked by Andrea and the breakfast she provided..On Xmas Eve Andrea even hosted a party for all the tenants ! Andrea has gone out of her way to help us navigate around Austin often ferrying us around for our trips to UT grocery shopping picked us up at the airport (we had  a lot of luggages !) and even helped us  move to our new apartment in Austin!. Both Andrea and George are very kind thoughtful  and helpful. We also met many other nice tenants from different countries often during meal times at the kitchen who have now became our friends whom we will keep in touch with after leaving this place. The atmosphere in the entire place is one that is very friendly and fun yet quiet and private. Overall we are extremely impressed and satisfied with the hospitality and help from Andrea and George throughout our whole stay. We will highly recommend this place to others. They are not just a host. They treat every tenant like their family and look after them. This is what makes the greatest difference. We will definitely recommend this place !
